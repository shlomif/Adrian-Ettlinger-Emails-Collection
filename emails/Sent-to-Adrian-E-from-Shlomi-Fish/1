You're welcome and I hope it works for you.

Ah. You said something about moving to Carmel or something like that. That
was some time after you turned 80 if I remember correctly.

Ah, my older sister (who is still younger than me) has been studying Medicine
as well (in the Technion in Haifa) and I think she is now in what we call the 
"staj" ("stage"?) where you are supposed to get some on-site experience.

Sounds asked.

That's good.

I see.

I'm familiar with Tel Aviv University. It's a walk away from my home,
and we used to hold the meetings of the Tel Aviv Open Source Club, 
and other club meetings there. I'm planning to resume the Tel Aviv
Open Source Club activity, but probably at different locations due to
lack of cooperation from the Tel Aviv University staff.

Nice.

No, it does not. I have graduated from the Technion in 2004 after 13 semesters
of study (which included two vacation semesters I took in the middle). I graduated
(from Electrical Engineering) with an average of 84.6%, which made me a cum laude
graduate. This was especially encouraging for me given the fact that I don't have as much
knack for EE than I do for programming and mathematics, and given the fact that I
never took a test or a course again if I got a passing grade (no matter how low). 

Since then I've been either working in various places or looking for a job. I wasn't
able to persist in the same job for more than 7 or 8 or so months, and I may
lack a lot of experience in certain fields that workplaces want, so it's been
hard for me to find a job.

I've been spending a lot of time working on the various open-source projects that
I am involved in and on some web sites I maintain. Right now I'm in the ongoing process
of spell checking my entire home site, for which I have written a few scripts. Today
I made my work-flow faster by using some UNIX shell and Vim tricks, which I hope will
make the rest of my work easier and quicker.

I have made quite a lot of progress with Freecell Solver, and been writing about
it on the fc-solve-discuss mailing list. I don't know if you are still subscribed there,
but you are welcome to join again. Recently, I have implemented a program to expand
multi-card moves into individual card moves, which was inspired by the fact that
at least people have reported that they cannot tell why a certain sequence move was
legal.

I've been mostly happy with the integration done to Freecell Solver into PySolFC, which
is an open-source Solitaire suite written in Python. You can see Freecell Solver there
in action here:

The PySolFC maintainers have not dealt promptly enough with my bug reports, but I suppose
it may still be good enough as it is for most uses.

-----

My other sister has graduated from Computer Science in the Technion, spent several
good years working at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_Design_Systems , until
she was fired from there, and is now doing an M.Sc. in Computer Science at Tel Aviv
University. I have seen working on a lot of Matlab code, and a few days ago I asked
her whether she was using a version control system for that, and she told me that
she doesn't use something organised. I can no longer imagine working without a good
version control system (of which there are now several very good gratis and open source
ones), so I concluded that I did not educate her well enough. ;-)

-----

Are you still reading a lot of books? I've been quite neglecting my reading, but I kinda
ran out of interesting books to read and I'm not dedicating a lot of time for reading bona
fide books. Right now I'm about to finish reading /Catch 22/ (which is not too bad, but I
had greater expectations for it) and am reading a book called "xUnit Test Patterns" which
is large and tedious, and quite redundant, but I lack better things to read. Someone from
South Africa I helped with some Perl code I maintain has sent me a copy of Umberto Eco's 
The Name of the Rose, so I'm looking forward to its arrival (non-air-mail...), because its
film adaptation was nice.

Anyway, I hope you feel good, and take care. There's a lot I can still tell, and you may
wish to tell me some more about what has been going on with you.

Regards,

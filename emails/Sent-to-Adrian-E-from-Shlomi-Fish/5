Nice, you can read more about its relation to Chanukah on the wikipedia. Of
course, from what I know, Potatoes were brought from the Americas, so potato
pancakes (or Latkes) should be a rather late tradition for Chanukah among J=
ews.

Ah, I see. Lately, there has been more variety in Sufganiyahs in Israel. So=
me
of them are now smaller than usual, some are filled with a different filling
and some are covered with various coverings. There's a small bakery/caf=C3=
=A9 in the
shopping centre close to my building, with really good baked goods of these
sorts. I also like to buy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6rek (which we
call Bourekas) there sometimes.

I see. You may have told me about it. A friend of mine who turned 50 a while
ago, also had a minor heart attack, so now he needs to go on a daily walk.

Ah, OK.

Yes, well, we had some alarms here in Tel Aviv, but no casualties. Most of =
the
missiles were destroyed by the Iron Dome system, but one of them hit a
building in Rishon-Lezion and caused some damage. Many Israelis are
frustrated that Israel accepted the ceasefire, and did not attack the Hamas=
 in
the Gaza strip. Someone on IRC said that The Art of War (which I
admittedly have yet to read) says that =E2=80=9CIf your enemy is begging yo=
u for a
ceasefire, that is the time to hit him hard.=E2=80=9D which makes sense in =
a way.
However, my mother noted, that there are various political constraints, like
our relationship with Egypt that need to be taken into account.

I talked with someone from India on IRC, who asked me what I think about the
fact that there were 3 Israeli casualties as opposed to over a 100 ones in
the Gaza strip. What he didn't understand is that the Hamas kept firing
missiles, and also used civilians as a human shield, and that Israel would
not have retaliated if they were peaceful (but they were not for a long
time). Part of the reason Israel had so few casualties is the fact that the
Hamas' competency at doing them is not too good. However, the many alarms a=
re
still disruptive to the lives of Israelis in the territories close to the
strip (including recently Tel Aviv, where I live), and Israel should be all=
owed
to retaliate against that.

The Hamas had a history of breaking the ceasefires, so we'll see how long t=
his
one will last. My mother also told me that in the Gaza strip, every three m=
en
form an organisation, so it was hard to maintain order, which reminded me of
this Monty Python skit:

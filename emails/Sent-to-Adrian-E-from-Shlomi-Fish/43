I think it very much has a point. I too have felt this, and it worries me a 
bit. One of the things I am most worried about is that Orthodox Jews will 
become a majority, and so use their electoral power to enforce a theocracy. 
This may cause a brain-drain out of Israel, or some secular militias to form, 
or even the Military (which consists mostly of secular or only moderately 
religious people[1]) to go against the government.

This reminds me that I started to write an essay in English about the proper 
solution for the Israeli-Palestinian Problem. I'm attaching the abstract and 
can send you the incomplete draft I have now. It starts with the short-term 
solution and goes on to propose long-term constitutional modifications. 
Everything is based on Liberalist principles.

Once I publish it, I accept quite a lot of resistance from most Israelis, 
because it deviates from everything most of them have been tought.

[1] - Despite being supportive of Israeli occupation of the occupied 
territories, most Orthodox (Haredim) Jews don't serve in the army, and are 
positively incapable of protecting themselves, or Israel at large.

I should note that I did not serve in the Army either, due to my tendencies to 
become depressive or euphoric. I did, however, wanted to serve their 
originally.

Introduction
    - Reference to the early blog entry.

The Status Quo
    - A partial Palestinian autonomy in the west bank and Gaza.
    - Many Israeli settlements in the occupied territories.
    - Palestinian terrorists enact many acts of terror against Israelis.
    (suicidial or otherwise).
    - Israeli Soldiers and Settlers are killing many Palestinians.
    - Israel gives relief to the Palestinians so they can survive.
    - Israeli Soldiers are protecting the Jewish Settlements.
    - The Israelis blame the Palestinians.
    - The Palestinians blame the Israelis (at least it seems reasonable
    to believe they do).

Some Ethical and Logical Facts: + Implications
    - A Person has a right to live everywhere. Depriving a person of his
    home is immoral.
        - Some things about nationalism, and rights to the land due to
        the ancestors living there.
    - No person can force another person to protect him.
    - The right to bear arms. (?)
    - A person or group who routinely blame their problems on others, is 
    behaving irrationally by believing he is not responsible for his own
    problems. Generally, a group should take responsibility for solving its 
    own problems.

How Israel can solve the problem?
    - Note that it is short-term, for the time being.
    - Give Israeli Soldiers a choice of whether or not to protect the
    settlements.
    - The settlements can either remain using only their self-protection or 
    that of the soldiers who are willing to protect them, or its settlers 
    can choose to relocate to Israel, where they will be given an alternate 
    home.
    - Possibly: Stop Giving Relief to the Palestinians. If it implies 
    establishing a Palestinian State, so be it.

Israel's Long-Term Solution for the Problem:
    - The core of the problem: Israeli Constitutional Racism.
    - Changing the Immigration Laws to be indiscriminatory to religions.
    - Making the army service either mandatory for every Israeli Citizen or 
    voluntary for all.
    - Civil Marriages, Divorces, Adoptions, etc.
    - Discrimination in Government Funding.
    - Conclusion
        - While it may not eliminate Arab hostility, it can certainly help.
        - If we are completely non-discriminatory, Arabs will have less and
        less incenitive to believe we are their enemy.

Palestinian Solution:
    - The peaceful and prosperous age a few years ago.
    - Stop the Terrorist Acts.
        - Better off bargaining without them.
        - Such acts only increase the Israeli hostility and hatred towards
        Palestinians. (or otherwise make them indifferent to what happens)
        - There are non-violent forms of opposing the occupation that
        are more effective (re: Gandhi and the Indian Opposition.)
    - Don't sanction terrorists or other activists, and those who are
    should quit.

What's wrong with the Geneva Accord

What's wrong with the Separation Fence
    - still based on the assumption that the problem lies in the 
    Palestinians. (the Israelis fail to take responsibility for their
    own problems)
    - 1000's of km long in a 250*100 km area.
    - Will probably be a huge environmental disaster.
    - Can potentially become a large defence problem. (at times of war)
    - Will make a lot of legitimate traffic very difficult.
    - May not prevent the terrorist acts entirely - most suicide 
    terrorist passed through border-passings.
    - Much less effective than withdrawing from the occupied territories
    and

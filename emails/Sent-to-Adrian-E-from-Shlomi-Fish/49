Yes. I've been to the IRC some time ago and talked with a friend who works in 
IBM. He told me that I should contact them again, because they may be a bit 
slow in responding. I contacted them again, last week, and the secretary told 
me that people have been abroad and stuff, and that I should call back at 
Sunday (tomorrow). So there is hope yet.

Well, there's always hebcal.com for that:

/me uses it. ;-)

Yes. It's usually called a "Matsiyah", but "Matsa Bryte" (sp?). I like it a 
lot.

OK.

OK.

Well, let me know what you've been up to lately. I can let you know my latest 
news if you'd like.

No, I first contacted you via Facebook, but then you have given me your E-mail
and I contacted you there.

Oh, I see.

See:

Namely, the first Chanukah Candle is on the evening of Saturday, 8 December
2012 (the evening between Fri and Sat), and it goes up to 8 candles (on 15
December). In Israel, we like to eat traditional Chanukah foods of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_pancake and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufganiyah , which are fried with oil, to
commemorate the pot of oil which was reportdely found in the second temple
untouched and was able to burn for the Menorah (the Candelabra in the temple),
for 8 days until more oil could be brought from the Galilee. I'm not sure
whether the diet of you and your wife will allow you to consume those, but
perhaps your children and/or grandchildren will enjoy them.

BTW, regarding your comment on Hollywood (and one of your grandchild's original
desire to become a filmmaker), you may relate to this Slashdot.org interview
with Wil Wheaton, who is a former Hollywood Child Actor, and now a voice
actor, a minor actor and a writer and a blogger:

<QUOTE>
 Child Actor Prodigy Success
by statusbar (314703)

It seems that most child actors end up growing up to be crack-heads,
drug-dealers, low class porn actors/actresses, and/or dead from bullets or
drugs.

How did you avoid all that mess? Was it easy or hard to avoid? Was there a
point in your life where you had to make a conscious choice? What would you say
to other child actors to help them avoid the pitfalls of early fame?

WW: I think not being on Diff'rent Strokes had a lot to do with it.

Thank you. Tip your waitress, and don't forget that you can play Keno right at
your table! Come back for the late show . . . it gets a little blue.

In all seriousness, I think most child actors end up as you described because
they believe all the hype they hear as kids. When I was a kid, it felt good to
hear from everyone that I was the next big thing, and I was always the golden
boy, and that I'd never lose the light in my eyes. Did I know it was all
bullshit? Right after Stand By Me came out, and I'd done some interviews and
dealt with some "Hollywood" people, I did.

Something kids and their parents (and all actors, really) need to remember is
that Hollywood is always looking for the next big thing; and that rarely means
the next amazing-but-undiscovered actor. In this business, a talentless whore
who gets fucked in grainy night vision is more valuable to the networks than a
talented actress who has spent years studying and honing her craft. That's the
reality of Hollywood in 2005, and if publicity and fame is more important to an
actor than the work, they're going find a void in themselves that can only be
filled by sweet, sweet heroin. Or late-night erotic thrillers featuring Shannon
Tweed and Lorenzo Lamas. See, fame comes from without, and the joy of
performing comes from within. Actors can always perform on stage (or start
blogs) if they can't get work in TV or movies. They probably won't get fame,
but they'll get the joy of performing.

I think that I avoided becoming a regular on Cinemax's late night boob-a-thons
because even when I was a kid, I quickly figured out the difference between the
kids (and their parents) who wanted to be Actors, and the ones who wanted to be Movie Stars. I never wanted to be a Movie Star, and the ones who did annoyed the hell out of me. They were the ones with the obnoxious stage parents, and we were the ones who just wanted to learn our lines and do good work. When we all grew up, guess who turned out okay, and guess who is selling his teeth on eBay? Okay, if I can drop a name for a second: I am lucky enough to have a signed copy of the book Sideways. When he signed it, Rex Pickett wrote,All that matters is the work. I think that's important and useful advice for anyone who gets into a business that mixes art and commerce. If the attention becomes more important than the work, you're boned.

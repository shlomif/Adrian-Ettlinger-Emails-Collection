According to what my sisters say it's $500 in the best case scenario. There 
are cheaper flights to Turkey, though, and many Israelis like to travel 
there.

Hmmm... yes.

Dominique Francon and Roark have a full (and secret) affair in the book.

Actually, Dominique in my parody is quite akin to the Friends' character that 
is associated with it. You may also notice that I very soon liberated her 
from much of the psychological jail she placed herself into in the book. In 
the book, she was very much not a free-living character.

Possibly.

I guess. At the moment, I think that I can make a good living out of 
programming while simply having writing as a hobby. I'm a pretty good 
programmer, too.

Well, according to this:

Rosh Hashana is on September 16th, (where the feast beforehand is on September 
15th).

Brith or more correctly Brith-Milah. Well, the brith took place on the baby's 
8th day by a Mohel, with a usual traditional ceremony. The celebration took 
place some time afterwards, when the baby had already been circumcized.

Yes, I hope I'll find a job soon too. Got some useful opportuinities so far, 
but nothing final yet.

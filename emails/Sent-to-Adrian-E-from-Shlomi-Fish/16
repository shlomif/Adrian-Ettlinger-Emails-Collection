OK. Well, I'm not sure I have enough connections in the industry and enough 
prestige to confidently become a consultant/contractor like that at this 
point.

I see.

Well, there's a software design methodology called Extreme Programming (or XP 
for short) ( http://www.extremeprogramming.org/ ) which is very hyped 
recently. One of the guidelines they are saying is that it is better to make 
sure the code itself is structured and refactored enough for easy 
understanding, than to have an obscured code that is adequately documented.

I'll give you an example. Suppose I have this code, in more or less 
pseudocode:

<<<
Process-Path(MyPath)
{
// Remove empty trailing elements
while (MyPath[length(MyPath)-1] == "")
{
MyPath.Pop()
}
// Do the actual processing.
.
.
.
}
>>>

We could do better than that, by extracting a function that will remove the 
empty trailing elements, and call it this way:

<<<
Process-Path(MyPath)
{
// Remove empty trailing elements
Remove-Empty-Trailing-Elements(MyPath)
// Do the actual processing.
.
.
.
}

Remove-Empty-Trailing-Elements(MyPath)
{
while (MyPath[length(MyPath)-1] == "")
{
MyPath.Pop()
}
}
>>>

And now we no longer need the "// Remove empty trailing elements" comment.

This is naturally a very simple example, but I hope you get my intention. 

Generally comments, much less external documentation, are not as optimal as 
having code that is easy to understand because they are usually not as 
consistently maintained as the code is, and because one cannot be sure that 
they are very easy to understand. Plus, people would rather read easy to 
understand code than code plus more documentation.

Heh. Of course, it's hard for me to tell why I was rejected from all the 
places that rejected me. I usually receive the usual generic answer.

One possible drawback to my C.V. is that I tend to work on many different 
open-source-related things, that each amount to relatively very little. Thus, 
not all of the hours I have of experience can be reflected in my resume. 
Usually I mention it in my cover letter to some extent, though.

I see. In your interview:

http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/interviews/adrian-ettlinger.html

You said that for PBS you did some programming for the Intel 4004.

Well, I was giving a lot of Jaynes' theory and summarized some of the evidence 
he cited (as I remembered it). From my impression, he makes an excellent case 
for supporting his theory, but naturally, one cannot know with absolute 
certainty, whether it is correct or not.

Well, according to Jaynes, the belief in gods preceded consciousness. And in 
fact, consciousness was a way to avoid the non-scalability of having to 
non-consciously be controlled by voices emanating from several parts of the 
right hemisphere, (and by the directions of the leaders).

After people became conscious, the belief in gods continued from the time they 
were bicameral. However, now they stopped hallucinating the voices of the 
gods (except in exceptional cases, like prophets or oracles, or 
schizophernics, or people who are possessed.) and the whole religious rituals 
were fully conscious. 

Now for what you're saying that people became conscious and then started 
believing in gods to explain natural phenomena which they did not have an 
explanation for. Well, it is certain that most mythologies tried to explain 
various natural phenomena by making use of gods. This was because at that 
time science was not sophisticated enough to give explanations for these 
things. However, according to Jaynes, bicameral people hallucinated the 
voices of gods for guidance, a long time before they developed consciousness. 
Thus, when they acquired consciousness, they had no choice, but to already 
believe in gods. The explanations for natural phenomena either preceded 
consciousness or followed it, but they were not the primary reason theism has 
evolved.

And, BTW, in the last chapter, Jaynes claims that increasingly, science is 
used as a source of external authorities, instead of religion.

Right.

What do you mean? Do you mean that consciousness is integral to the rest of 
the brain's functions, or cannot be separated from it? (I'm waiting for your 
answer so I can better reply).

I see. Yes, I heard about that, and my father and mother (who are in their 
50's) seem to go through a similar phase.

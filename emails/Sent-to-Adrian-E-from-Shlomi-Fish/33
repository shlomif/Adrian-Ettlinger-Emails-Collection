Yes, that makes it clearer.

Actually, consciousness has several valid definitions. One is the mental 
process that gives one a sense of self. (which is what Jaynes deals with). 
Another is a state of enough awareness to physically react to external 
perceptions. ("The Dog lost Consciousness", "The patient regained 
consciousness".). Another is simply a synonym for awareness in the more 
commonly used sense. ("Are you conscious that he is scheming behind your 
back?") 

Now, the point the review tried to make was that some people believe 
consciousness is required for such operations as learning, thinking, 
reasoning, etc. while Jaynes in fact points that it isn't. His concentration 
on consciousness is simply as the process of self-awareness and how it 
affects the total mental process.

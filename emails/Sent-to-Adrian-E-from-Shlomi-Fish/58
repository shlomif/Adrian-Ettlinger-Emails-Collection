They played this deal on MS Freecell when he was watching, and he was 
watching.

It is possible MS Freecell has a bug.

Don't know. They thought that Ma'ariv or Microsoft is going to send them to 
meet him, which isn't going to happen.

"Gmar" is End. "Hatimah" is Signing, and "Tovah" is good. So it means a good 
end of signing. According to Jewish tradition God signs the fate of the 
person for the next year on Yom Kippur and so it's a common blessing for this 
day.

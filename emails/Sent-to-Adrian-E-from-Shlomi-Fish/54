Hi Adrian!

I'm quoting your other letter here so the conversation won't be split.

I see. Saying what you think, in case it's in opposition to the opinion of =

I think associating criticisms of the war with criticisms of the troops is =
a=20
=46aux Ami (sp?) here. The troops are following orders, and doing what they=
 can=20
do within the constraints given on them. The war may or may not be the righ=

thing to do, and the troops have nothing to do with it. There were many=20
pointless wars in history (The Vietnam War and the Lebanon War come to mind=
).=20
The troops were not ultimately responsible for them. One can say the war is=
=20
irrational and should be discontinued, and it's not an indication of lack o=
f=20
support for the troops.

I may be preaching to the choir. In any case, do you recall such evasions=20
regarding the criticisms of the war during the Vietnam War?

I'm not sure the U.S. military is responsible for that guerilla warfare. It=

was probably inevitable once the main Iraqi military was defeated.

Well, only the future can tell. Right now, I don't see too much hope for pe=

Cyrus... yes, I well remember him. He is called Koresh in Hebrew, and I=20
mistakenly believed he was called "Karsus" in English. I recall he was once=
=20
the ruler of a relatively small principality called Persia (or "Paras" in=20
Hebrew), within the larger ancient kingdom of Maday (don't know its English=
=20
name). He and the main Maday government reached a disagreement, which cause=
d=20
a war that ended in Persia taking control of the entire Maday (and renaming=
=20
it to Persia until this very day). He then went on to conquer the Kasdim's=
=20
empire (which was ruled from Babylon).

Afterwards, he issued "Cyrus' Statement" in which he gave the various peopl=
e=20
in the new empire, religious/cultural and to a lesser extent some economica=
l=20
freedom, and allowed them to return to their homelands, from the exiles tha=
t=20
the Kasdim (and previously the Assyrians) brought them to.=20

Cyrus' Statement is quoted and referenced in the Old Testament, but a copy =

it (written upon some sort of cylinder) has been found in diggings.=20

Well, one good thing about the Gaza disengagement is that less troops have =

protect the settlers, and we have less settlements in the area that are stu=

Maybe. This talk about Einstein has reminded me of another thing that Paul=

Graham said. He said it here:

http://www.paulgraham.com/hs.html

And I quote:

Right. I met with him yesterday's evening and we sat in a cafe close to my=

home and signed a simple contract and discussed the design of the first par=

of the project. Today, I actually did some work, but it was only in writing=

design and planning documents and some browsing in CPAN (Comprehensive Perl=

Well, in Israel among non-religious Jews there tends to be a very strong=20
antagonism against religion. Due to the many religious regulations that are=
=20
in place, or that the Orthodox Jews push for, many people feel like they ar=
e=20
forced to behave religiously without having any substantial religious faith=
=2E=20
As such there are many people (including many high profile ones) who are=20
critical of religion among the secular Jews here, and several people are=20
proclaimed atheists.

I believe I've described the poor situation with the Orthodox Jews in our=20
previous conversations.

We learn quite a lot of pre-independence Israel in school. (I can only spea=
k=20
for myself - there are signs that public education in Israel has seriously=
=20
deteriorated in recent years). This is what I recall:

1. At first, there was Ha'Haganah (Hebrew for "The Defense") which aimed at=
=20
giving the Hebrew settlers an adequate defense against Arabs (which the=20
British army of the mandate did not provide). They didn't initiate any=20
pro-active terrorist activities.

2. A split from the Haganah formed the Etzel, which did initiate terrorist=
=20
activities against the Arabs. Ze'ev Zabotinsky, who was the leader of the=20
revisionist movement in Israel, at first disapproved of any terrorist=20
activity and later on approved of only such one against the Arabs.

Menahem Begin who succeeded him after Zabotinsky's death, interpreted his=20
platform after WWII as such that approves of violent actions against the=20
British.

3. During WWII there was a split of the Etzel to the Lehi, because the Etze=
l=20
decided to discontinue actions against the British for the duration of the=
=20
war.

4. For a brief period (a few months) after WWII the Haganah joined the Etze=
l=20
and the Lehi in performing terrorist activity, (the so-called "Va'adath X")=
=20
but they eventually discontinued it.

I do not approve of either the Lehi or the Etzel, and do not believe they h=
ad=20
a mandate to perform their actions. In any case, the streets of the=20
neighbourhood in which I live are named after Etzel and Lehi activists who=
=20
were sentenced to death during the Mandate. I personally find a hard time=20
seeing them as heroes. (assuming of course they weren't innocent by=20
accident).

That's right. But these people were well-aware of the consequences of them=
=20
moving to the Gaza strip. If they wished to have a solid, long-term home,=20
they should have remained within territorial Israel.

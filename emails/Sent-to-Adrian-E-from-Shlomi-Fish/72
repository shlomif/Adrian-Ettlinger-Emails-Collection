Hi Adrian!

I'm sending this message from my home address where I have a better mailer and 
is in general more convenient for me. Please at least acknowledge that you 
have received this message, because I had problems with my ISP's E-mail 
server being on anti-spam black-lists.

Well, since the last keepalive (about the etymology of the word Freedom) a lot 
has been progressing. If you haven't been following my weblog, I can say that 
the following has happened:

1. I finished the studies for this semester and now have a tests period. I 
could not study for the tests too hard because I am in an euphoric state (a 
variation of anxiety) and so don't have the mind for studies.

2. Instead, I'm spending my time riding the bicycle, hacking various things on 
the computer, corresponding with people, chatting (IRC, IM, etc).

3. In regards to our meta-political discussion, I revamped my "Solving" 
initiative to make it much better:

http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/philosophy/solving/

What I now propose is for self-appointed leaderships will compete for leading 
the country along with the "official" elected leadership. So instead of 
having a dictatorship of an elected leadership, we will have a competition of 
several leaders.

Some people whom I told them that, thought it was akin to Feudalism or to 
Anarchy, so read the material there, if this sounds fantastic to you.

4. I also made a huge revamp for the Perl Beginners' Site:

http://perl-begin.berlios.de/

It's much, much better now in many respects. 

I talked with a few of the admins of the perl.org domains about having better 
resources for beginners there. At first it escalated into a flame-war, but 
then someone told us that the perl.org servers suffered a hardware failure 
and so we needed to have some patience in getting things done.

So, I was re-directed to instructions on how to contribute and wrote a nice
page (which mostly re-directed people to the appropriate pages at perl-begin).
I sent it as a diff.

Meantime, one of the admins who reviewed perl-begin.berlios.de claimed it was 
"recycled horse manure" and that even the design of learn.perl.org was much 
better. I and other people think he's very wrong on this. But who is John 
Galt?

5. I also did a lot of work on the Better-SCM site:

http://better-scm.berlios.de/

This is a site for advocacy of various version control systems. I know you're 
using a poor-man's version control system of keeping several zip files of 
various dates around, but you may like Subversion much better if you give 
yourself some time to learn it. (you can toy with it a bit, before you start
working on real projects with it).

There's an entire book on Subversion here:

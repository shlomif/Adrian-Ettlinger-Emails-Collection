Hi Adrian!

Listen - it would be very hard for me to fix what I have now based on the 
deltas you sent me. What I suggest you to do is:

1. Prepare a new zip file of FC-Pro.

2. Download it to a different directory on your development machine and see 
that you can build it there.

3. Put it online somewhere or send it to me. (preferablly the former) You can 
also send it to my gmail account (shlomif@gmail.com) but note that you should 
notify me on it by emailing here.

This way its integrity can be ensured.

I should also note that I've tried running the FC-Pro binary under WINE, which 
is a virtualization layer for running Windows apps on top of Linux. It ran 
fine from what I could tell. I didn't try to build Freecell Pro using libwine 
yet, but I might try it soon.

Regards,

Hi Adrian!

I received your E-mail and will reply to it when I have the time and feel like 
it. Before I go on, I have three remarks concerning your previous E-mail.

1. I kept Passover Kashruth (i.e: did not eat Hametz) during the Passover. It 
wasn't a religious custom for me, but rather an ethnic one. I don't maintain 
normal Kashruth, though, and eat Pig's Meat, etc. Such customs may be 
considered ethnic customs as well, but I find them a bit more religious 
because they are over-stressed in Israel, religion-wise.

(I did eat bread crumbs as part of Shnitzels my mom prepared, but I don't feel 
guilty about it, because, like I said, it's part of my religion, which I have 
none).

2. I got a 56% or 57% or 58% percent final grade in Statistics which is just 
above the passing grade, so I'm happy. BTW, the cross-semester average grade 
in this course is 62%, from what the lecturer told us (AFAIR) so this is not 
a bad grade.

I believe that this makes me eligible from graduating from the Technion, but 
have to find out what the exact procedure is. I may have to wait until my 
grades enter the grades' tracking system (at the moment, none of them did). 
And I'll try to find out what the procedure is.

3. I still find you made a complete logical error when claiming that the 
social security systems in many democracies nowadays are voluntary. A 
voluntary action is such that is done out of one's own free will, without 
being forced to do so. At the moment, we are _forced_ to pay for social 
security. If not, we will go to jail. Some people may not like this, and 
would rather not pay, while not receiving social security in return. They 
cannot.

Thus, it isn't voluntary. One can argue whether it is good or bad, but it is 
mandatory and not voluntary.

This is similar to the draft vs. voluntary service argument in Israel. The 
government puts a gun to your head and forces you to serve in the army. If 
you are qualified for service, do not lie to get out of it, and simply stress 
that you refuse to serve in the army - you'll go to jail.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

Hi Adrian!

Please acknowledge you have received this message.

I'm replying to the last message that I sent you in order to re-new the 
conversation. One thing I need for you is to re-prepare a package of the 
Freecell Pro source and this time make sure that once you unpack the zip, it 
builds correctly from beginning to end.

How have you been these past few months? Have your wife and you settled in 
your new house already? How is your family doing? How was the weather in 
New-York?

I have quite a lot to tell you about myself. We had OSDC::Israel::2006 here 
last week (OSDC == "Open Source Developers' Conference"), where I gave a 
short presentation about Test::Run.

I'm looking forward to resuming our correspondence.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

95% of the programmers consider 95% of the code they did not write, in the
bottom 5%.

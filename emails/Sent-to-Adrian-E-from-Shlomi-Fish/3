Hi Adrian,

hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving. Hanukkah is upcoming as well, and somewhat
later Christmas (which we in Israel do not commemorate).

In any case, I hope everything is OK. Why have you not replied to my
earlier message (quoted below). It's possible that you did and it was
considered spam by my spam filter (though it seems unlikely). I'll
check.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

Hi Adrian!

Next time, please avoid top-posting (see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style ). And I also suggest using 
Thunderbird ( http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/thunderbird/ ) instead of MS 
OutLook Express. The latter is much less standards compliant than Thunderbird 
is, and has had many security problems in the past.

That's because I edited it on Linux, where it uses the Unix-only LF trail.

Right. From my experience, banning people like that is not the right way to 
deal with them. Too bad many people (especially those with very little 
experience and/or those that lack tact and/or stupid ones) don't realise 
that.

Right. I also think that on the Internet banning someone is relatively 
effortless and seems innocent enough to do without muhc thought. However, it 
has a lot of implications. In real life, you are not likely to boycott 
someone you dislike or to request the authorities to deport him or to ask him 
to leave your house, (etc.) because you're aware of these implications.

I see nice. Where do you live? You can also point me to the Google maps point.

Actually, I am in a way. I live in Ramat Aviv Gimel, Northern Tel Aviv. The 
country club is an Urban structure. Here's where I live:

Yes. I personally think that the "g" ( 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_intelligence_factor ) factor of 
intelligence, was a bit silly, as there are a lot of aspects to it. For 
example, people with an Audible congition tend to be better at maths than 
people with visual cognition (see 
http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/783 ), while people 
with a visual cognition have better memory, where a photographic memory is an 
extreme case of it. I once tutored someone with a photographic memory who 
scored very high on his history matriculation exam after he learned the 
entire textbook by heart, but had problems with Physics. I have an audible 
congition and can never expect to learn so much text by heart, though I tend 
to remember many songs pretty well.

Well, I don't know exactly what the complaints were about. It was not a blog - 
I was banned from sending email to the entire @perl.org/@pm.org domain, after 
making some posts that annoyed people on the Perl-Mongers mailing lists, and 
they contacted postmaster@perl.org instead of me directly. (And letting me 
know how I feel.)

Then when I tried to discuss it with him on irc.perl.org (a chat network), he 
banned me from it as well. I find many other people in the Perl community 
annoying in some respects, but I still respect them enough (see my email).

First stop for Perl beginners - http://perl-begin.org/

The bad thing about hardware is that it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.
The good thing about software is that it's consistent: it always does not
work, and it always does not work in exactly the same way.

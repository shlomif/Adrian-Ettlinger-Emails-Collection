Hi Adrian! I'm glad to finally have received a new E-mail from you. Hope 
everything is OK. In case you haven't been following my blog 
(http://www.advogato.org/person/shlomif/), I graduated from the Technion, and 
am now looking for a job. As you may have noticed, I started writing a new 
story in English, and am very excited about it.

The lack of a job, gives me a lot of time to ride my bicycle, rest, play mp3s 
on the computer, write essays, hack on open-source software, send a lot of 
E-mails, talk a lot on the IRC and IM, and generally have a lot of fun. I 
still would like a job, though, because I could use a positive flow of 
income. So far I had several job interviews (some of which went pretty well), 
but not a final offer for employment.

What's up with you?

OK.

Well, the novel has a relatively good ending. At least for Howard Roark.

Well, I recall seeing a survey on the Internet that tried to determine your 
orientation in the political map. One axis was personal freedom and one axis 
was economic freedom. Libertarianism is the extremes of both. Left-wing is 
now the extreme of the personal freedom and the anti-extreme of economic 
freedom. Right-wing is the extreme of economical freedom and the anti-extreme 
of personal freedom. I misplaced the URL to this survey, and could not find 
it otherwise.

Note that up to a certain point in history, many liberals were in fact 
pro-economical freedom. The relatively free market economy and the advent of 
Socialism and Social-Democracy has caused a split in the "liberals" that 
brought the left-wing and the libertarians.

I have read the book. It's a very good book, highly entertaining and highly 
insightful. My sister read the book after I read it, and it's now her 
favourite book and she keeps raving about it. My other sister has now started 
reading it. I also wrote a parody about it here:

Haven't seen the movie yet.

I haven't seen the movie so I cannot testify. I have nothing against people 
voluntering their time, money, efforts, etc. to benevolent collectives. Even 
if the collective is less than benevolent, (i.e: not doing anything illegal, 
but still harmful) people still have a right to donate their resources to it.

The important thing is that you mustn't sacrifice the lives, well-being or 
property of people other than yourself for this. 

Ayn Rand has not lead an ideal personal life, to say the least, despite having 
made an almost flaw-less contribution to philosophy and to literature. One of 
the Neo-Tech advantages touches upon this issue (advantage73.html in the zip 
archive I sent you).

Looking forward to it.

I'll try. They demonstrated how to prove it to the reporter. But when I asked 
them to download Freecell Pro and record the solution, they said that they 
expected to meet with Jim Horne later on, and show it to him. I eventually 
reached the reporter on the phone, and he said that from his impression, they 
indeed wanted to gain something from it.

Because neither Microsoft nor Ma'ariv (= the newspaper that reported it), want 
to spend the resources to make them meet.

They don't know.

He didn't. It's just that there's a small distance separating between 
them. :-)

No, he's not. He's very much alive.

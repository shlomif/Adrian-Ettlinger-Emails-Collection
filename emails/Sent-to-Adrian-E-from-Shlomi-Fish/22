Well, that's a diversion from what I was meaning. I was talking about 
different classes of freedom:

1. From opression.

2. From responsibilities.

3. From having to pay money.

4. From work.

You are talking about different aspects of freedom, all belong to #1 or #2. 
But let's continue our discussion.

I don't understand how political freedom can lead to a lessening of social 
freedom. Political freedom is something that everyone can exercise. All 
individuals. The important thing is invididual rights, not minority rights.

I believe that in a proper Liberalist country (where Liberalism is the 
original term held by Washington, Jefferson, Ben Franklin, etc. and not the 
modern "liberals" of the left-wing), the minority can always fight against 
the measures that the "majority" or an elected leadership tries to impose on 
it. To quote Benjamin Franklin:

Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have
for lunch. Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote.

Unless, of course, the government is minimalist, does not have social welfare, 
and does not charge 65% of the wage of working people as is now the case in 
Israel. If a government charges 10% or 20% in taxes or none at all, and only 
linear income tax (i.e a fraction of the pay above a certain amount), then I 
can say that I do not work half the time for the government. But with Israel 
it's like I'm working for the government most of the time. In Israel, the 
middle class is very poor in comparison to other Western-world countries. 
It's an outrage.

I do not. However, I sometimes do use Hebrew for messages I write to 
Hebrew-speakers. So it is possible the messages are sent in UTF-8 (which is 
an internationalized encoding) by the mailer by default. (to accomodate for 
all possibilities). I have no idea what I can do about it, but maybe you 
should just install the foreign-language handler.

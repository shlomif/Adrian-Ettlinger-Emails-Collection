Ah, OK. Many people told me the Hummus in Israel is much better than most
American ones.

I see. Nice.

I should note that according to http://www.hebcal.com/ the first candle sho=
uld
be lit at Saturday's nightfall (between the Sat and Sunday daytimes). What
makes it more confusing is that in the Jewish tradition, the day starts at
nightfall and extends to the night and the day time (Possibly due to Genesi=

days).

Yes, I'm normally saying the prayers around here. There are some complicated
rules for when to say which one so we look it up in a book we have about
Jewish traditions.

Thanks. I've also started working on the backend for a commercial site -
https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=3D#!topic/redisters/Qagmq4edgOo=
 (hope
you can get past the stupid AJAX URLs that Google has been inflicting on us,
and you are welcome to join the redisters Google group - everybody is), but=
 I'm
still getting distracted with other (and potentially less profitable stuff)=
. I
also may be looking for jobs and projects not intensively enough.

I wanted to tell you that I've been doing some work on PySolFC
( http://pysolfc.sourceforge.net/ ), which is an open-source (and
cross-platform) suite of Solitaire games which has some support for Freecell
Solver. PySolFC is a culmination of many forks of PySol, which has gone
undermaintained, and now it seems that due to the existing PySolFC maintain=
ers
being unresponsive, there is a risk of more forking. One funny thing is tha=
t I
think I now work on computer games and solvers more than I actually play th=
em.

BTW, you may find this list of Japanese-style logic games on my site
interesting:

http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/japanese-puzzle-games/

The most popular of them appears to be Sudoku, but I don't like it much, bu=
t I
like the other variations on the theme, and have been working on solvers for
them. I've been looking into contributing to a Nurikabe solver, generator a=
nd
player written in Java, but I've noticed that its Swing-based UI is incredi=
bly
buggy (with some comments acknowleding that no less) and that Java in gener=
al
lacks a good cross-platform GUI library:
http://shlomif-tech.livejournal.com/65009.html . I've been contemplating
writing the GUI in Perl using Perl/Qt or whatever and while using Inline::J=
ava.

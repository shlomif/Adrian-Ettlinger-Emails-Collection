I see.

Hmmm... I worked in several workplaces between high school and the Technion. I 
was able to save a rather large amount of money as a result (10,000 NIS or so 
IIRC), which was later used to pay some of the Technion related bills, and as 
a result I ended up wasting it all. Now, I have about 2,500 NIS from Articles 
I wrote and from other gigs like that.

But I really would like a steady job with a nice payroll, instead of the 
relatively unpredictable flow of income from articles and gigs.

I think what brian d foy said was a generalization. Probably some companies 
would like people who are independent, think outside the box, and are not 
very small-minded. These may work in an open-source environment or they won't 
(albeit may use some open-source technologies).

Interesting. Was that related to your Z-80 project? Or was it beforehand, with 
the Intel 4004?

Yes.

Are you buying your books from Amazon.com? They have wishlist and other 
mechanisms for that.

My point is that the origin of religion according to Jaynes is a bit 
different. It was not a grand scale conspiracy by the leadership in order to 
justify wars. In fact, the origins of religion come from a time in which 
people were incapable of conspiring. 

Religion and gods did originate as a way for people to lead themselves and 
organize themselves into operating societies. What happened was that as 
people developed language and conceptual thinking, they started hearing 
voices that guided them. (all while being unconscious) This was a 
continuation of the brain's operation while being non-language-aware.

Then they started building societies, etc. Jaynes talks about a proto-culture 
near the Sea of Galilee in Israel. What happened was that a society elder who 
was served as a leader, was buried in a way that allowed him to be 
continually fed and consulted. What Jaynes claims is that his voice could 
still be heard. Thus, what happened was that he became the first god, who 
guided the rest of the settlement posthumously. 

As societies grew larger, they added more gods, whose voices were heard. The 
leaders spoke to the gods and led the people accordingly. Each person had his 
own personal god (which the Egyptians documented as a "Ba", something that 
was mistaken as the "spirit" of a person), and there were also greater gods 
whom the leaders spoke to, or people came to consult with.

However, this model of leading (as you can imagine) could not scale very well, 
so civilizations eventually tended to collapse. Only due to the geography of 
the near east, there was no place where they could dissolve. Jaynes mention 
two occassions (the rise of Assyria and the eruption of a volcano in the east 
Mediterrenean Sea) that caused a lot of chaos. As a result, people 
independently developed consciousness in order to survive, guide themselves, 
and not need the entire leadership of the Gods. (Plus, many other 
advantages).

However, the vestiges of the non-conscious mind still remained. People missed 
the Gods, and tried to resurrect them (Prophets, Oracles, etc.). People also 
sought ways to predict the future, and instruct them what to do (Omens, 
etc.). Eventually, organized religions and other such mystical belief systems 
were developed.

My point is that it's not as if people were conscious and had leaders and 
these leaders, due to the fact people viewed them only as humans, and knew 
they could be wrong and made mistakes, conjured up deities to validate their 
instructions, and to give a more substantial claim to their orders. Instead, 
the gods were once tied with the leadership of the different societies 
non-separably, and this was still when people had no consciousness and had no 
free choice.

In a way, religion is a tool of control. But its origins are not as part of a 
scheme of the leadership, but rather was tied together to leading right from 
the beginning.

Well lately, I've been waking up rather late (after 10:00 AM or so usually), 
and then working up until sometimes between 22:00 and 24:00. I recall going 
to bed early once and then still waking up rather lately. I also seem to 
remember that I am a bit self-aware relatively early in the morning, but 
still sleepy and unable to rise up. Sort of like I'm a bit awake, but then 
falls to sleep again.

I often also rest at the late morning or in the early afternoon.

When I was younger, I used to wake up very early, and then go to sleep at 
22:00 P.M. Nowadays, I seem to like to sleep into the mornings.

When I get a job (without jinxing myself) I'll probably have to get used to 
waking up earlier during weekdays. (and probably will go to sleep somewhat 
earlier too).

OK. But please at least keep me updated on your news (and possibly comment on 
mine).

It was made available here:

http://fc-solve.berlios.de/don_woods.html

(and also the vipe.technion.ac.il mirror which is currently unavailable)

Only problem is that berlios.de has blocked downloads of compressed archives 
from their sites (probably to encourage people to use their "Downloadable 
Files" service).

Meanwhile you can find it here:

Well, as I recall some compilers prepend an underscore to identifer names, and 
the linker is trying to find them. Try looking for "dest_stack_len".

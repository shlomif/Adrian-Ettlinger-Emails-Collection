Hi Adrian!

I did not mean to send this letter as it is, but instead put it in my drafts 
folder for later composition. However, it was sent and now I can't really 
remember what I wanted to add.

In any case, I had a relatively hectic couple of days. On Thursday, I woke up 
prematurely at 3:30 AM and decided that it was one of these days that I did 
not want to go back to bed. I stayed awake until I went to sleep at around 
23:00. At first I started working on making sure a Perl module has 100% test 
coverage as part of the Phalanx project:

http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2005/01/13/phalanx.html

However, some things in the module were relatively anachronistic and quite 
annoyed me so I delayed continuing working on it. So instead I went to 
continue working on preparing a vector graphics sketch of the left pane in 
this panel strip:

http://www.ozyandmillie.org/2005/om20050208.html

I made a lot of progress. What I have now seems to resemble the lower part of 
the original, but the curves are still quite non-identical. Nevertheless I 
want to complete everything and then to fine-tune everything at the end. (I 
can send you what I have so far).

Working on such an image is relatively tedious, so I alternated between doing 
it and doing something else. Throughout the day I found myself to be pretty 
bored, so I decided to try doing something productive and hope that the 
appetite will follow the food.

So I set out to work on a project which I started and then abandoned to write 
the SVN::Pusher module and the svn-pusher command line client. I wrote a 
basic version of this utility called "svn-push" in C which is working but is 
very limited, and I wanted to write it in Perl so it will be more flexible. 
Someone wrote a module called SVN::Push and placed it on CPAN which contained 
a similar functionality, and I decided to base on it. However, after 
converting the code to do what I want, I encountered some problems, and thus 
abandoned it for a while.

So on Thursday, I went back to it again, was able to find a workaround for the 
bug that troubled but encountered other bugs. I resolved them as well, and 
when I finished late at night (22:00 or so) I had a working version. I still 
have some work to do, but I'm glad that I was successful. Most of my problems 
were caused by the fact that what I wanted to do was quite different than the 
original's code, but at least the API was bug-free.

I conversed on the IRC almost the entire time, in hope that people can help 
me. I think I found out the problems on my own eventually, but it was still a 
fun conversation.

Then when I checked E-mail I found out that some folders had 30 or 20 
messages. Apparently the flame-war that was started here:

http://gadot.fdns.net/lurker/mindex/hamakor-disc%4020050722.134115.90d49004.en.html

Really heated up. It all occured because someone who is a member of the 
Israeli local Free and Open Source Sotware (FOSS) Community is quite tactless 
and tends to troll and insult people a lot. As a result this discussion 
heated up and people tried to reply against the accusations. When this member 
was decided to be moderated, people tried to say it was a wrong decision to 
moderate him, and as a result a lot of further accusations were thrown.

This has caused several subscribers to leave the mailing list, some people to 
request to revoke their membership from the Israeli FOSS NPO, and one member 
of the board to resign. (claiming that the board should have the approval of 
the assembly) Now it seems like it has hopefully cooled down a bit.

In any case, I did not have a time to catch up with it too closely at that 
point, because I had to go to sleep. I was waked up at 6:30 AM by my Sleep 
Alarm, because I was picked up at 8:00 by Lior Kaplan in order to upgrade the 
server iglu.org.il (known as eskimo to the adminstration group), from Debian 
GNU/Linux 3.0 ("Woody") to Debian 3.1 ("Sarge"). Despite the fact Sarge is 
a .1 release, it was about 3 years since the previous release, so it's the 
most fundamental upgrade to Debian so far. We also wanted to install a new 
320 GB hard disk there.

The upgrade took some time, but went quite well. Lior was a big help. One 
problem we encountered was with setting up the RAID array. It seems that the 
previous tool chain for managing them was no longer available, and the 
replacement required some tweaking to be compatible with it. I won't bore you 
with the technical detail, but eventually we had to do a relatively ugly 
kludge to get it to work. Luckily there was pretty good documentation 
available on the disk.

After we installed the hard-disk, we had to format it, which took a long time. 
This gave us the opportunity to eat, so we went outside, and bought Shawarma 
( http://www.gomideast.com/articles/shw1.htm ), and went back. The formatting 
was finished and we decided that everything was in order and we could 
continue doing the rest from remote.

I should note that the place has left quite an impression on me. The Eskimo 
server is hosted in the server farm of an Israeli ISP called Actcom, which is 
very friendly to Israeli Open Source Activities. It occupies most of the 
second floor of a building called "The Tower of Haifa" which is relatively 
old. The rooms and corridors looked relatively dirty and neglected. The 
server room was heavily crowded with servers one next to the other. I was 
told it "looks like shit" on one occassion but I was actually relieved when I 
saw how it really looked like. We spotted other servers we were familiar with 
there.

We had to work in the room of the Technical support people. (Four supporters 
crowded in one room with microphones, computers, etc.). So we listened to 
their conversation and had to be quiet. We worked on the remote computer 
through a mechanism that allowed seeing the screen output of the computer on 
our local screen. The local computer which we sat next too has ran Windows 98 
and we had a graphical browser, an SSH client, etc. available there.

After we were finished, Lior drove me to the Train and Bus station. The last 
train to Tel Aviv was leaving, so I decided to take the bus instead. Then my 
father drove me from where the bus stopped. I arrived at the house at around 
16:00, washed my face and ate, and then went to the computer to catch up with 
the E-mails.

Someone actually told me that he'd like to hear my opinion on that. I answered 
him that I was busy working on SVN::Pusher and upgrading Eskimo, and so could 
not engage in something less productive like a grand-scale flame-war. 
(Someone has to do that...)

In any case, I cought up with the rest of the correspondence, and wrote some 
E-mails summarizing my opinion.

Meanwhile it seems that a server on the Technion (vipe.technion.ac.il) which I 
have an account on, to read E-mails and host some web stuff, has become 
disconnected yet again. I feel like I'm missing a bone or something. I went 
to sleep at around 22:00, but fell asleep only at around 00:30.

I had a good night sleep, and woke up today at 11:30 AM. I feel refreshed from 
the sleep, which I did not get enough of for two consecutive days. Today I'd 
like to ride my bike, so I'll get some sporting activity.

------------------------------

I hope I did not bore you telling you all that. This will probably go in my 
weblog, but I wrote it to you first. I hope you'll have (or are having or 
had) a good family vacation at the beach.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

Tcl is LISP on drugs. Using strings instead of S-expressions for closures
is Evil with one of those gigantic E's you can find at the beginning of 
paragraphs.

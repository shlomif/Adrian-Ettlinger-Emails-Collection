Hi Adrian!

I'm glad to hear back from you finally. After you haven't replied to all my 
emails for a long time, I was worried something was wrong.

Have you gotten used to your new house already? How are your children and 
grand-children doing? Any news on the railroad history front?

I have plenty of things to tell you, if you're interested in hearing them.

Happy Upcoming Shavu'oth!

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

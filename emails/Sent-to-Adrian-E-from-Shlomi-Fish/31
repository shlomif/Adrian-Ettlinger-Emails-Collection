Well, let me explain. Assuming you understand the word "consciousness" in this 
context as I do[1], i.e "the mind process that gives a person a sense of 
self". Now if we agree that it can be conceivable that a man or an animal 
would have a fully functional mind and body operations, but nevertheless will 
not have consciousness, then we can conclude that he or she still hears 
sounds.

What Jaynes meant, were that the brains of pre-conscious men, generated voices 
that were processed by their mind as if they were heard. Now, these voices 
were not "real" in the sense that they were not external voices actually 
registered by the ear. However, they were "heard" as if they were real by the 
part of mind that is responsible for hearing. Ancient men, operated based on 
these guiding voices, which were eventually associated with the various Gods.

Now, I called it "hallucinating", and I think Jaynes used this term as well. 
But your choice of word can vary, without it changing what he meant.

[1] - I could not explain to my father, for example, what consciousness is. 
This is despite the fact he is otherwise very intelligent and has a Ph.D. in 
micro-biology.

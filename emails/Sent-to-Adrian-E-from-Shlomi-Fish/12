Sounds good.

Well, I had a few job interviews but nothing final yet. I was rejected from 
the positions at IBM Haifa R&D Lab. I was also rejected from another position 
at a relatively small company called Jungo, after an interesting interview, 
that from my impression went relatively well. There was this one company that 
I decided to avoid being hired to, after they made a bad impression on me. 
Then I heard that they were even worse, after someone I know told me that his 
friend who worked there, and quit and told him some awful things about them. 
(so I was right in my gut-feeling.)

A few of my articles were published since, for which I earned some money. But 
not too much - there's a limit to how many I can write and get published.

Other than that, I'm helping in organizing community events. I started 
organizing Israeli Python meetings, where Python is a computer language which 
is similar in its capabilities to Perl (and compete for much the same uses) 
but with a radically different way of doing things. We had two meetings in a 
shopping mall, but now we found a place where we can hold presentations.

Hmmm... usually you are saying words I have to look up, but now I've surprised 
you... As you may have guessed "prepend" is like "append" only involves 
insertion at the beginning. It's less commonly used than append, because 
adding to the end is naturally much more common. Still, I heard it being used 
occassionally.

Yes. Just send it to me and I'll re-post it.

The keyword here is "more". I think that the unilateral withdraw from the Gaza 
strip is a step in the right direction. Those settlers cost a lot of 
resources (even lives!) to maintain there, and just make everybody - Israelis 
and Palestinians - angry. We would be in a much better position to protect 
against potential threats from the Gaza strip once there won't be any Jews 
there.

The Ironic thing is that the Gaza strip is not considered part of the Israeli 
Fatherland according to religious Jewish tradition. It is considered part of 
the Land of the Philistines, and the Laws of the Land of Israel are not 
relevant there. Some of the settlers make their living by growing crops there 
with permission during the Sabattical Year where according to the Bible, one 
should not grow crops in Israel.[1]

This reminds me that the Philistines in the Bible, actually called themselves 
Palestinians (after the Greek god "Pales"), and were called so by the Greek. 
The Greek initially tended to think of what the Jews called "Eretz 
Yisra'el" (or "The Land of Israel") as "Palestine", as they did not 
distiniguish between Jews and other kinds of Semite people, and were familiar 
with the Philistines who shared a language and an origin with them. Later the 
name "Palestine" was re-adopted by the Romans after the destruction of the 
Second Temple.

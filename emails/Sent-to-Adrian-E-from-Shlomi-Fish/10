Hi Adrian,

how are you doing? I hope is everything is OK. Please keep in touch.

Tomorrow is the eve of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah , which =
is
the start of the Jewish new year. I hope you'll enjoy it.

I have an interesting story about it. In Israel, it is customary among secu=
lar
Jews to hold a feast with the family and possibly the extended family on Ro=
sh
Hashanah, but when I asked a moderately secular Jewish American friend he t=
old
me all they do on Rosh Hashanah is go to the synagogue and pray. Then, when=
 I
told that to a religious American Jew, he told me that the feast (or "Se`ud=
ah"
in Hebrew) is an integral part of every Yom Tov (or "a good day" in English=
).=20

Anyway, I've started working on Sunday, 1 September, and now there are goin=
g to
be several breaks during this month for the Tishrei (=3D a Jewish month)
holidays, but my past days have been pretty productive. I'm going to have a
trial period of three months and hope I'll like the job and they'll approve=
 of
me as well. One of my friends (and fellow FOSS developers) there is
contracting for them.

I really look forward to this job, because lately, I've ran out of major th=
ings
to do during the day, and have been kinda bored (or maybe the right word is
lethargic). I don't feel like doing anything, though in actuality, I spent
most of my time doing one thing or another. Working at a job keeps me occup=
ied
and I'm also getting paid, and I don't find working on the code for work too
uninteresting.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

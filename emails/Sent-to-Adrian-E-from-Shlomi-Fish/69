Hi Adrian!

There's a link from http://www.rrhistorical.com/rrdata/Fcpro65/ to:

* http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/freecell-solver/

However, the correct link is http://fc-solve.berlios.de/ . Please correct it.

Moreover, I told you that you should send me an up-to-date version of the 
Freecell Pro sources that will be self-contained and made sure to compile 
cleanly on Windows. So please do so.

I'm still awaiting your response.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

I met a guy in the bar, talked to her and she gave me her phone number.

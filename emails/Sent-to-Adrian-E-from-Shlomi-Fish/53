OK. I'll do that.

I see. One should note that there are some cultural differences between the 
Iraqi Shi'ite and the Persian ones: the former speak Arabic, while the latter 
speak Farsi. It also involves their origin as primarily Semitic/Arab people 
vs. primarily Indo European people.

Interesting. That borders on censorship. Do media people say those things or 
only right-wing leaders? (such as Republicans, religious figures, etc.)

"serendipity" is an interesting word. I first heard of it here:

http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/09/09/lightning.html

According to 
http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=serendipity it comes 
from the Persian Fairy Tale "The Three Princes of Serendip". I believe I've 
seen it on the Hallmark channel.

Interesting.

Did he went from one institution to the other, and each one had its own 
reasons for not hiring him? Or was it because of some reputation he got?

Yes, I know.

OK. I don't suppose you were still at your beach vacation when writing this 
E-mail? (it's been over two weeks since 29/7).

In any case, here are a few notes of interest:

1. A girl I know wrote a summary of the disengagement from the Gaza strip from 
her Point of View in her blog:

http://www.livejournal.com/users/real_skeptic/14165.html

I read the blog entry, and found it to be quite interesting. I haven't 
followed the disengagement with all of its mini-events too closely, and was 
just aware that it happened with some resistence. She, on the other hand 
seemed to have been more attentive.

There are also several blog comments (quite long as well) which I have not 
read yet.

2. I'm now in about the middle of reading "Guns, Germs and Steel". The book is 
very interesting so far, with many interesting facts and curiousities 
presented there, and also a very interesting general theme.

This book has reminded me of Jaynes' book when I heard of its concept, and now 
I realize that it was probably for a good reason, because they have very 
similar themes. So far, it seems both books are orthogonal and touch on 
different aspects of the post-Ice Age human history.

3. On the job front, I now have a contracting (or perhaps outsourcing) 
opportunity presented to me by a fellow Perl Monger, who has his own company 
that does such consulting as well as open-source training. It is in Perl and 
for a web/Internet-related project, which I have quite a lot of know-how in. 
If I accept it, which so far looks like what I do, then I'll be occupied for 
the time being, and also receive some positive cash-flow.

According to his planning, this is a project for a month or two, which will 
leave me able to find a more permanent job later on. I'm not that interested 
in dabbling in web programming for the long term, as I'm more interested in 
something like Embedded software, more hard-core Networking, Signal 
Processing, etc. or otherwise more proper software development. This project, 
however, sounds interesting and it's not a long-term commitment.

I'm also reminded again that I should post a "I'm available for hiring" E-mail 
message to several mailing lists I'm a member of. I haven't done so in a long 
while.

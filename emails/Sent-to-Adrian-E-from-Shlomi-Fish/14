Did you mix the numbers, or had a typo? Because you say that where you're at 
at the moment (Vineland, NJ) the price of gasoline is cheaper than where you 
live. ($2.19 vs. $2.69).

Yes, I was told that you don't find jobs from newspaper job ads (where they 
are flooded with resumes) but rather mainly from contacts. Recently I also 
enrolled in an HR agency my friend recommended, and I heard from them a lot 
on various matters, and also got my resume sent to several companies and had 
some job interviews.

As for the small company, there are companies of all sorts of sizes in Israel. 
Many small or start-up companies tend to be run by people without much 
experience or knowledge in software and worker management. As a result they 
are often notorious for having bad management, crazy working hours, and 
sub-standard working conditions. There are various exceptions naturally. The 
larger a company is, then usually this situation is better as far as the 
grunt employee is concerned. 

I heard of other opinions regarding what to do. A certain "brian d foy" (a 
well-known Perl guru) said in his blog that software companies are basically 
looking for people who will do what they tell them to do, who will be 
specialized in a certain area, and not think too much outside the box. Thus, 
programmers who have had extensive involvement in the open-source movement 
will not usually be good candidates for them. (And I am such a case). Thus, 
such developers should realize that once they are independant, they should 
remain independant.

Paul Graham (http://www.paulgraham.com/) recently raved about a theme of 
university students or graduates starting their own start-up comapnies in 
several of his essays. I'm not that keen on starting my own company because:

1. Managing companies is a lot of hassle. I tend to become nervous and anxious 
very easily. Doing voluntary work, studying or working as a grunt programmer 
is bad enough, but trying to manage something seems like that I won't be able 
to stand one minute of.

2. Right now, there's a lot of demand for clueful Linux programmers in Israel. 
It is the right time to become employed, and not a very right time to look 
for employees.

3. I have some ideas but they are not particularly good. 

4. Making money out of marketplace (or so called "shrinkwrap" software) is 
difficult. Both commercial software and open-source software (and all the 
rainbow in between) have their own difficulty in trying to make a living out 
of.

A better idea perhaps would be to become a consultant-slash-contractor. I 
forgot to mention that Intel Haifa contacted me about consulting for them 
regarding the Subversion version control system. This is due to them seeing 
me mentioned in various contexts about it. (I have written about it and to a 
lesser extent contributed to it in various places). Eventually they found 
someone else, who also had a contractor status from the government (I happen 
to know him very well), and he's consulted for them for one session. He told 
me that maybe I should understand that I can earn such status by directing my 
open source work to such venues, so people will know and hear about me and 
would like to hire me as a consultant. (Lately, I've been doing small amounts 
of work on many projects.)

Right.

Well, there were probably various settlements in the vicinity of Gaza. The 
Region occupied by the Philistines in the Bible also included such ancient 
and modern cities like Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath (now Qiriath-Gath), etc which 
are part of territorial State-of-Israel at present. So I suppose their status 
in regards to Land-of-Israel is similar.

In any case, the Gaza strip was conquered by Egypt and as a result its people 
were evacuated during the Israeli war of independence. The settlers came 
after Israel has re-conquered the strip in the Six Days War. I should note 
that when the Peace agreement with Egypt was signed, the Egyptians got Sinai 
back (albeit as a territory in which they cannot put any troops in), but 
refused to get the Gaza strip back, claiming it belonged to the Palestinians. 

Another thing to note is that many of the pre-Independce Israeli settlers were 
not religious, but rather believed that Jews were a people. There was a large 
number of Socialists among the many immigrants to Israel. (which is still 
evident in the Israeli political map).

Hmmm... Interesting. The First Crusade (as well as later happenings such as 
Saladin, etc.) were covered in my junior high school's history book, which 
I've read almost fully out of interest.

In any case, this reminds me - did you eventually buy Julian Jaynes' book 
about "The Origins of Concsiousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind"? 
I can point you to a few summaries:

1. Neo-Tech summary - http://www.neo-tech.com/neotech/discovery/nt3.html. Not 
bad, but Neo-Tech oriented, and so heavily biased. It also doesn't mention a 
lot of evidence and facts brought in the book, which present the foundation 
for the book's arguments.

2. Wikipedia:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origin_of_Consciousness_in_the_Breakdown_of_the_Bicameral_Mind

Short URL - http://xrl.us/gxwx

Somewhat laconic, but more Neutral Point-of-Viewish.

---------

Right now I've started to read Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs and Steel". It 
tries to explain how since the Ice Age, different parts of the Earth Human 
Populace evolved differently because of environmental differences. (like 
geographical, or bio-geographical). My father has read it and raved about it 
considerably.

I should note that according to some things my father told me about the book, 
it seems like the author is wrong in some places. Among else, he claims that 
religion was a tool devised by the leadership to justify wars, a claim which 
doesn't hold water, according to Julian Jaynes theory. In some cases, what my 
father said from it was very enlightening, nevertheless.

Have you read it yet?

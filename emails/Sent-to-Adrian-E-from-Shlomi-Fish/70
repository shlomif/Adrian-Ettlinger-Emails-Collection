Hi Adrian!

It's good to hear from you.

See:

http://www.tranzoa.net/~alex/plspider.htm

He contacted me about it back at 2005 . He also sent me the source, but it has 
some dependencies on his own private libraries, and is also multi-threaded 
(due to a bad reason of bad design).

Happy Hanukkah to you as well!

Nice.

BTW, recently I've been playing mostly Nurikabe ( on 
http://www.logicgamesonline.com/nurikabe/archive.php ) as well as the daily 
games on http://www.brainbashers.com/games.asp ). I've started writing 
solvers for Kakuro and for Nurikabe, but they're still in early stages of 
development and are not really usable.

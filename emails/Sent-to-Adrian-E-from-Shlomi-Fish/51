I am quite well known in some circles here in Israel (and to a lesser extent 
outside it). The problem is that I'm mainly involved with the Israeli online 
and offline (i.e: meetings, conferences, etc.) Open-Source community. There 
are a lot of industrial workers, even those who make use of some or many 
open-source technologies who are not very involved in the community. In fact, 
I recall that when the Israeli Perl Mongers got hosted at Dapey Zahav, than 
our contact person there (who was once upon a time my former boss) could not 
convince many of them who worked there and dealt with Perl on a day-to-day 
basis to attend our meetings. (which were free of charge)

Hmmm... well I lost track of what you were referring to here. (had to look 
back in my archives) That's the problem with your way of maintaining the 
thread's integrity.

Well, I'd rather not correct the text of Interview itself, because this smells 
like lack of journalistic integrity. I could add an after-the-paragraph note 
using some markup, though to correct this.

I did not hear of it. But I've been relatively out of touch with contemporary 
Israeli events, recently. I hardly watch T.V., or read newspapers, read 
mostly open-source-related news on the Web, and only hear of really major 
events through my friends' hearsay. I'm also out of touch with current 
Israeli show-biz.

Maybe an Israeli cannot afford to do that, but I find keeping updated with all 
the minute events frustrating and quite pointless. I once attended a 
conversation in a workplace I was working at (Harmonic Lightwaves, I worked 
there during one Summer in research), where a fellow engineer said that 
contemporary political events were like "White Noise". I.e: a lot of things 
are said or happen, but they amount to nothing. He then added that 
occassionally something really big happens, which is quite important. I tend 
to agree with that.

I recall that Arthur Conan Doyle said in the first Sherlock Holmes story how 
Holmes described the human mind as an attic, which you cannot fill 
indefinitely, or else you won't have any more room left. What Sherlock Holmes 
did was explicitly making sure he did not remember things that were useless 
to him. For example, he did not remember that the Earth revolved around the 
Sun, and said it would make little difference if it had revolved around the 
moon. It was of no relevance to his doings.

Maybe me trying to ignore current affairs is such a filter. I already remember 
a lot of useless stuff (or memes that seem useless to me). But I also need to 
remember a lot of useful things. I'm not trying to justify it, just saying 
that I don't feel like I benefited a lot from keeping up with the random 
political news, and now that I don't, I don't feel bad about it.

Right. There's a different between mental awareness and sentience. One may 
have mental awareness, but not sentience. (consciousness can mean either one, 
BTW). According to Jaynes, sentience requires language, and is a layer of 
brain "software", that was developed only very recently. Whether this is 
true, or whether even less intelligent animals have sentience, while still 
remaining uncapable of speach or being relatively unintelligent, is not 
entirely conclusive. Jaynes gives a lot of evidence to support his claims, 
though, and I tend to find his theory plausible. But who knows, it might 
prove to be false.

Well, I had a few things I wanted to write to you, but I'm delaying it for the 
while, because I spent a lot of time writing E-mails today as it is, and I 
have many other things to do. It's just that a relatively old friend has 
re-surfaced again after a long time of inactivity, and I wrote to him several 
E-mails yesterday and today.

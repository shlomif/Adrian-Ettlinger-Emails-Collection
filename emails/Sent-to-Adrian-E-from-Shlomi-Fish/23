Hi Adrian!

Sorry for not responding to you sooner, but my mind was occupied with two 
tests I took as part of my Technion studies. If I pass these tests, then I 
graduate from the Technion, and so I believed that I'd rather not become 
anxious due to our philosophical discussion. I hope you understand.

As you wish.

One should distinguish between freedom from responsibilities and freedom from 
oppression. For instance, if someone tells me that I cannot say this and 
that, then I'm oppressed because saying it is not one of my responsibilities. 
If on the other hand, I'm saying: "Work is cancelled for today. I'm free!" 
then it is freedom from responsibilities. I am not forced to work by anyone, 
but it is one of my responsibilities. Freedom from opression includes liberty 
of speech, liberty of choosing your workplace, the freedom to own and 
maintain ownership, etc. Freedom from responsibilities includes not having to 
work, not having to take care of your children, not having to study, and 
other responsibilities like that.

No, what I meant is that sometimes people use the terms "freedom" and "free" 
to mean that they are no longer subject to some responsibility or the other. 
I'm not saying a completely free man should have no responsibilities. Much 
the contrary. However, the word is often used to mean that. (like I 
demonstrated above)

No, I meant something like: "The first two drinks are free."; "Get a free 
E-mail account.", "Free hosting for your web service". Etc.

No. In Hebrew the word "Hufesh", which means "Freedom" also means a vacation. 
So, it is a lack of work.

By political freedom, do you mean the right to vote and run to elections? Or 
do you mean something else (like opposing political candidates, saying things 
that oppose the current regime, etc.)

Yes, it is. Women and those who support abortion can form militias who will 
vow to protect and allow people to get abortions.

It is as far as my father tells me.

Actually, there's much more government waste in Israel than just the army. A 
lot of money goes to:

1. Financing a sub-standard public education system, which is constantly 
slumping.

2. Financing the education of Orthodox Jews (Yeshivas, etc.)

3. Social Security, and other welfare laws. (which do much more harm than 
good)

4. The army is otherwise very bloated and inefficient as far as spending is 
concerned.

5. Financing the protection of a lot of occupied territories settlements.

6. Financing many NPO's, many of them are just tools to extract money out of 
the government. (why?)

7. Other spendings which serve no good reason.

Isreal has one of the highest percentages of people believing that the 
taxation is too high in the industrialized world.

Or set of competing governments within the same country.

Actually, there is still no reason to say that liberalism supports government 
welfare, etc. You can call it by a different word if you wish, but you have 
to stick to the original meaning of the term. And I think that an 
industrialized economy is a much better place to live than a 1780's U.S. 
economy. And so there should be fewer problems.

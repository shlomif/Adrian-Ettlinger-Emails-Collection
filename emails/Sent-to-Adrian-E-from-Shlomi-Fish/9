Hi Adrian,

We have stopped talking in December (of 2012) when it was Hanukkah, and you
haven't replied to what I said yet, so I'd like to restart the conversation.

How are you? How was the new year? How are your family doing? I hope everyt=
hing
is OK with you.

As for me, I'm still unemployed, but got two leads for jobs in
work-from-home startups in the Tel Aviv area, both of which are currently
looking for funding. Maybe it will keep me busy for the time being.

I've been taking a more active part in socialising, going out and
interacting with various people, etc. I also attended a
Science-Fiction/Fantasy/etc. conference in Tel Aviv back in passover, and it
was a great experience for me. Here are the photos I took during the second=
 day:

And here is my report about it:

I think me socialising more has helped me a lot with dealing with my
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder . I have also reached many ne=
wer
conclusions thanks to my therapy.

Anyway, I've been working a lot on many resources on my homepage and public=
ity
of them. Links to them are in:

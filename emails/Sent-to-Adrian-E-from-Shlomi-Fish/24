Well, you shouldn't. The Technion gives very hard tests, and these were no 
exception. I took two courses this semester, which I took by telecommuting 
back and forth from home to the Technion:

1. Thermodynamics - in this I solved the homework in the first part of the 
semester, and neglected doing everything during the second part. In the 
vacation, I finally went over the material again (books, homework, etc.) 
solved everything, learned everything, etc. 

2. Statistics - in this I did not attend a one hour lecture during the 
weekdays, because it was the only thing I needed to study at that day, and 
covered the material from someone else. I prepared the homework and handed it 
in, but I neglected studying it during the vacation, because I was busy with 
Thermodynamics.

Now, I missed the first chance exams because I was in an Euphoric state and 
was unable to do anything of this sort then. So I went to the second chance 
exams. The Thermodynamics test was a multiple answer one, with some questions 
specifying that there is more than one possible answer. It was also 8 
questions instead of 10 for the first chance exam, and lasted 2 hours instead 
of 3. I did not know how I fared when I left it, but now the grades were 
published and I got 78% (where the passing grade in the Technion is 55%). 
This is a big relief.

As for Statistics, I took the exam, and did not know how to solve some of the 
questions there. So I handed it partially unsolved. I have a mini-exam I took 
in which I got 70% which protects the grade somewhat. But I still don't know 
what my final score is, and I'm skeptical in regards to it. If I don't pass 
it, I can get a third chance exam, in which I can further prepare more and 
hopefully know the material better.

I'm a bit critical of myself for not having studied harder for Thermo, and for 
getting into a useless web-forum discussion in which people attacked me two 
weeks before the first chance exam. (which caused me to have an Euphoria) But 
I cannot change the past.

Perhaps.

It is indeed. But it is often used in this context to indicate that. "I don't 
have work today - I'm free!". "Today my mother takes care of my children - 
I'm free!", "People should be free from having to pay for their children's 
education". etc.

I believe freedom is first and foremost "liberty", i.e freedom from 
oppression. All other uses are misueses of it. But I mentioned them because 
they can often be encountered.

It can be a very long-term period as well. "I won the lottery - now I'll be 
free from having to support myself for the rest of my life."

If you say so. But these are various context in which the words "free" or 
"freedom" are used.

Many people would agree with me on my points there.

I'm not saying the abortion-supporters should wage war against those who don't 
support it. But they should definetely protect themselves.

But what if these doctors were armed. So, when they had been attacked they 
would have responded with an armed weapon? Or the entire abortion clinic 
armed?

I got a bit tired of that discussion (Laissez-Faire, etc.). But if you wish to 
continue in it, so be it.

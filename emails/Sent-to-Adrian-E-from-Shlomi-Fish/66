Hi Adrian!

Thanks for the prompt response, and sorry for the lateness of mine.

Yes, indeed. Israel is too dense to afford such an extravagance in "country=

an "health club".

Top-posting is what you're doing now - replying to the entire email at one =

replying to each section after it, so we both don't lose context.

but it's still a good idea not to top-post.

Yes, it is a mailing list.=20

Well, actually Jaynes' definition of Consciousness is quite narrow in 
comparison to other researchers and philosophers. He claims it is not 
necessary for talking, reading and writing, thinking, learning or even 
reasoning. Where do you see that this review claims that it is too broad? Can 
you quote.

Well, actually, Jaynes identifies that the voices heard by modern-day 
schizophrenics are the same mental phenomena as the hallucinating Gods of 
ancient times. In fact, after the development of consciousness, Prophets, 
Sybils, Oracles, etc. still reverted to the bicameral mind to hallucinate 
such voices. So, it is highly possible these people actually heard something 
that they identified as the voice of God. But it wasn't really God it was 
just their mind generating bicameral voices.

Jaynes claims that such individuals heard these voices throughout the day, and 
they guided them. They needed the voices for guidance, and they were 
identified with the Gods.

Seven (!) books? Wow, you're even worse than my friend whom I told you that 
judging by his weblog he reads a lot. Of course, it is highly possible you 
allocate more time to reading books than I do, and, naturally, you probably 
read English faster than I do, because I'm not a native English speaker. (I 
actually know that I can read Hebrew faster than I read English.)

Oh well. In any case, I hope you enjoy reading Jaynes' book in due time. It is 
very interesting and captivating.

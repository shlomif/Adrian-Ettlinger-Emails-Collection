Hi Adrian!

What's new and what have you been up to? How are your cats doing? What about
your children and grandchildren? I hope everything is OK. It's been a long
time.

I can tell you more about my whereabouts after you reply, but regarding
your question about how to remove someone as a Friend on Facebook, then
do this:

1. Go to their facebook page - there is a link to it on every message from
them.

2. You should now see a "V Friends" button where the "V" is a small tick. Click
it and hold the mouse button.

3. Choose "Unfriend" at the bottom.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

actually, it did, though a lot of it is borrowed from various sources. See =

There's also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummus#Controversy .

Thanks! I'm still looking but often I'm considered underqualified or
overqualified or my C.V. just gets lost in confusion and they even don't
acknowledge that they have received it. I recall receiving some rejections
letters in the (physical) mail and now I often don't even get "We got your =
C.V.
and we'll look at it" E-mails. It's possible that companies are getting too
many CVs now, but often it happens even when they publish a wanted ad on
various open-source forums. =20

Ah, OK. I normally don't visit my Facebook page (too much junk
information (and that's often an overstatement) going on there), but perhap=
s I
should visit it once a day to learn about my friends upcoming birthdays. I =

set up a daily alarm for it.

I'm sorry to hear that his health is declining. I hope he makes it through his 
illness.

As far as I recall yes. I've been on Salt Lake City in a family trip to the 
U.S. about 12 years ago. I recall a few things from there.

Are you sure it is because of their religion and not because of other factors? 
During the middle ages when people were very religious the average murder 
rate was higher than in modern society. Of course, people then were poorer 
than modern-day mormons.

It is also possible that Mormons are harmed by religion in other ways. Like 
unnecessary guilt, unhappiness, etc.

What's "stalart"? Did you mean "stalwart"?

I read that in the Hackers' Jargon File:

MicroDroid n. [USENET] A Microsoft employee, esp. one who posts to various 
operating-system advocacy newsgroups. MicroDroids post follow-ups to any 
messages critical of Microsoft's operating systems, and often end up sounding

So how is the analogy with Mormon missionaries relevant here?

:-). Well, I don't buy into the fairy tales of the Jewish folklore (including 
the Old Testament) either. At one time, the organ of the Hassidic group 
"Habad" mocked the secular Jews for becoming exhilirated from the "Harry 
Potter" series, which was clearly fantastical fiction. The newspaper 
columnist (Meir Shalev) who reported it, said that their rejection of the 
Harry Potter series was encouraging. Now he expects them to also reject the 
myths of "Elijah Potter and the Priests of the Ba'al", "Moses Potter and the 
animating of the staff.", "Ha'ARI Potter the Holy", etc. (sorry, I'm a bit 
forgetful of the various Biblical and folklore miracles) That was a funny 
column.

Actually, Sunday in Christianity is not necessarily a Sabbath. A Sabbath is a 
day in which no work is necessary to be conducted. Sunday for the Christians 
is a holy day, but for many times, they studied or even worked at it. Ditto 
for Friday for the Muslims. In the Qur'an, Muhhamad specifically says that 
the Muslims should attend the global prayer on Friday's morning, and then can 
go along with their business (trade, etc.).

Jews don't stick to Saturday as an anti-thesis to Christianity. Saturday has 
been the traditional Jewish Sabbath for generations, a long time before 
Christianity. Jewish Believers respect it as dictated in the Old Testament. 
Christains nominated Sunday as a holy day as an anti-thesis to Judaism, based 
on the various myths of Jesus. 

Note that the length of the week was not consistent in the Ancient world. In 
Rome, the week was Eight days long. (with a rest day at the end). Jews 
probably followed a different 7-days long week.

Interesting.

Yes. 

Note that I just finished reading a very interesting book, that is summarized 
and reflected upon in one of the Neo-Tech articles I read. The book is "The 
Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind" by Julian 
Jaynes.

http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0618057072/qid=1083058761/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/104-4036651-7656754

What this book claims (and bases on a lot of evidence) is that until the late 
second millenium B.C., men were completely unconscious and operated by 
hallucinating the voices of various gods in their heads and following them. 
This is in fact the origin of the conscious religion, which is still present 
today. Consciousness in fact nullifies the voices of Gods and enables a 
person to control his own actions without external guidance. 

I can highly recommend this book.

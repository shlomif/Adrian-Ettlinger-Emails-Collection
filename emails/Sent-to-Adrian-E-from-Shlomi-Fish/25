I suppose. I have neglected my studies a bit this semester. And the anxiety=

Well, I understood what entropy is. It's the amount of lack of information=

that exists in a system. Generally, I think Thermo as a whole was a bit=20

Of course, this course is practically useless as far as an Electrical=20

On a second thought, I think I've made a bad analogy here. It's not relevan=

I disagree here. Rights are "individual rights", not "minority rights". Rig=

How exactly will the majority realize that? And what happens if he doesn't =
and=20
the minority is unarmed? Furthermore, what happens when the elected dictato=
r=20
decides to tyrannize the people and they are unarmed. This is not an issue =
of=20
"minority rights". It's an issue of individual rights as applied to each an=
d=20
every individual of any minority.

The only way the people can protect themselves against abuse by the governm=
ent=20
and other factors is by arming themselves. Imagine a man shooting another m=
an=20
in the middle of the street, or trying to rob him, in a country in which=20
everybody carries guns? Naturally, he wouldn't want to do it, because=20
everyone will see what he did and shoot him. Now apply it to an abusive=20
government in a country with well-armed citizens.

There's what I call a principle of laziness. An army left with a draft, wil=
l=20
almost necessarily become less and less effective and rational in time. A=20
public education system will necessarily become of lesser and lesser qualit=
y.=20
That's because they don't have an incenitive to improve.

Similarly, a government given the power, can in fact eventually abuse it if=
=20
there are no elements in the public to stop it. And it will transform itsel=
f=20
into an elected tyranny.

What makes you think that? I fully agree with this quote, by the way. I thi=

there are many honest businessmen out there. (in a much greater ration than=

I don't think so. Government welfare is a great scam as it is.

It is. The government puts a gun to your head and forces you to pay taxes.

Perhaps.

In any case, I'd also like to re-discuss religion with you. You claimed tha=
t=20
religion has done more good to the world than harm and I disagreed with you.

Here is an excerpt from your last E-mail regarding this subject and I'll=20

I think this tradition was fully conscious and well-known at the time, and =

practiced by people all over the Roman empire. The Christians simply=20
propagated the lie that by keeping "spiritual cleanness" they could be=20
equally as clean as maintaining "physical cleaning". And this was based on =
a=20
lot of irrationality and so was an evil thing to do.

Yes, but during the Roman Empire period women were much less opressed than=

they were during the middle ages. The church forcibly opressed them. It=20
opressed men and women alike and made the period very unhappy.

>=20

I think my denouncements of religion as a destructive force is based on a=20
different notion. Religion is mystical and irrational. It subjects persons=
=20
and groups of persons to deities and higher "causes" than their own=20
well-being, prosperity and happiness. It teaches them a lot of dogma that h=
as=20
no basis in reality. It expects them to be obedient and humble instead of l=
ed=20
by their own free will and proud. It is simply a tool to control, and a=20
remnant of our not so long ago past in which people were still unconscious=
=20
and hallucinated and followed the voices of the "gods" that were a product =
of=20
their unconscious mind.[1]

I'll give you some examples. Take for example this very well-known and=20
well-established concept in Christianity, excerpt from the New Testament:

<<<
You have heard that it was said to the people long ago, 'Do not murder,[1] =
and=20
anyone who murders will be subject to judgment.' 22But I tell you that anyo=
ne=20
who is angry with his brother[2] will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone=
=20
who says to his brother, 'Raca,[3] ' is answerable to the Sanhedrin. But=20
anyone who says, 'You fool!' will be in danger of the fire of hell.=20
=2E..
***But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already=20
committed adultery with her in his heart.***
>>>

Now, here Jesus says that a man can be found criminal of his feelings and=20
emotions. Yet, a man has no immediate control of his feelings and emotions=
=20
and should not feel guilty for them. A man can feel anything. He can even=20
feel a desire for mayhem and murder. Only acting upon these feelings can be=
=20
judged.

Neo-Tech says it so:

<<<
Emotions are not subject to condemnation, guilt, or right or wrong=20
judgments...only actions are right or wrong.[ 14 ] Next to the mystical=20
concept of original sin, perhaps the most pervasively damaging, unjust=20
concept projected by the Christian ethic is the moral judgment of emotions.=
=20
Especially malevolent and harmful are the condemnations of emotions such as=
=20
found in the Sermon on the Mount: "But I say unto you, that whosoever looke=
th=20
on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in h=
is=20
heart." By condemning human emotions, Christian neocheaters discovered an=20
effective tool to condemn everyone...to make everyone guilty, keeping them=
=20
more controllable for usurping power and values. Since everyone by nature=20
possesses a full range of automatic feelings or emotions that cannot be=20
directly controlled, shut off or stopped, nearly everyone is victimized by=
=20
Christian-style "sin" and "guilt".=20


While everyone innocently experiences negative, irrational emotions, no one=
=20
ever has to act on such emotions. And since only human actions are subject =
to=20
choice, only human actions (not emotions) are subject to moral judgment.
>>>

(advantage 37)

Thus Christianity has put guilt into many innocent individuals, and used it=
 to=20
manipulate them and control them and claim they were otherwise guilty. It i=
s=20
a daylight crime that deprives people of their rightful happiness.

Or take Islam for example. The Qur'an is littered with sayings that say tha=
t=20
the non-believers should be killed. Lots of them, all over the place. It wi=
ll=20
take a very wild and untrue to the text intrpretation to believe it is not=
=20
intentional. I claim it is simply that. The Qur'an advocates murder and=20
mayhem of innocent people. Plain and simple.

Other religions are filled with all kinds of such irrational beliefs and=20
dogmas. In the Bible, many orders are explained simply by saying that it is=
=20
the will of God. What kind of an explanation is this, the will of God? I ca=
n=20
say everything I want about the will of God is, and many people have put=20
forth various theories of what the will of God is before me. If you want to=
=20
prove something, you need to derive it from more basic assumptions,=20
eventually from just logic and the basic natural laws of existence.=20
Otherwise, one should never make way for dogma of this kind.

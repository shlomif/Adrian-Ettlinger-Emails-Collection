Interesting.

Well, I think what Objectivism idealizes (the super-productive individuals) 
does not mean that normal people who just go on with their lives, and don't 
harm anyone are bad. In fact, some of the most productive individuals in 
history were raised by people who were quite simpletons.

One of the chief mistakes of Ayn Rand was to promote good behaviour instead of 
trying to eradicate bad behaviour and bad beliefs. Neo-Tech is specifically 
about "Liquidating Negatives" and not "Inducing Positives".

Well, the origin of Rand's new name is not something that people are certain 
about. I heard several different reasons for it. (one of them showed that 
signing her name in Russian looked similar to "ayn rand" when written in 
English). Also note that the initials A.R. remained the same.

Well, I did not interpret it this way. I agree that Atlas Shrugged does appear 
to convey a meaning like this on its surface, but you have to understand it 
better than that.

Well, one thing this biography misses is the fact that Rand wrote some books 
on philosophy. ("To the New Intellectual", "Capitalism - The Unknown Ideal", 
"The Virtue of Selfishness", etc. You can find them on Amazon)

Well, Ayn Rand and her followers had very strong feelings against Fascism as 
well. Objectivism denounces all forms of collectivism.

Well, there are other great objectivists (some of them have known Rand) living 
today. Leonard Peikoff does. (http://www.peikoff.com/) I have no idea where 
he's living in, or he might travel a lot. There are also a bootload of the 
Neo-Tech crew. (like the people who go by the pen names of Frank R. Wallace 
and Mark Hamilton) I am disappointed that they removed the Neo-Tech 
literature from www.neo-tech.com. 

However, I have something in mind that will hopefully do the best to remedy 
it. What I'd like to do is start a public Wiki (not unlike the Wikipedia - 
http://en.wikipedia.org/) which people will be able to fully edit and add 
content to. The collective license would be the Creative Commons Attribution 
License which allows for a lot of flexibility in its use. Hopefully, I and 
other Neo-Tech fans can eventually fill in most of the original content that 
is present in the books.

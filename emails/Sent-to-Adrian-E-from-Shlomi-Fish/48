Hi Adrian! 

Have you received this E-mail of mine? You haven't replied (or at least I 
didn't receive a reply). In any case, happy Passover, (it's on the Eve of 
Saturday a week and a day from now). 

Have you been too busy to answer? Please at least acknowledge this message.

I'll be happy to hear your news as well (and have some new news of my own)

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

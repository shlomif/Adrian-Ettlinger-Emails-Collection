This isn't my "real" reply. It just had a few notes on our correspondence that 
weren't particularly related to anything. Mostly personal stuff. I _will_ 
reply to you later on, just not now.

Kashruth is the property of being "Kosher". (its derivation from "Kasher", 
which is the Hebrew form of "Kosher" is part of the insane Semitic language 
rules for transformations of verbal roots. Let me know if you'd be interested 
to hear more of this linguistic musing.) Sort of like "Kosherness" in 
English. (which is not a real word, but could be).

"Hametz" is indeed leavened bread, at least I think it is based on your 
context. I was not familiar with the English equivalent term and did not have 
the time to look it up, and so assumed you'll be familiar with it.

Yes, you told me about that.

My parents and my sisters had not kept these prohibitions. I guess I was the

mind upon it.

Thanks!

Interesting. I know that in Tel-Aviv University the passing grade is 60%, but 
the Technion is still considered tougher. (probably the tests in TAU are 
easier). Don't know about other universities. What is true is that a student 
with an average below 65% has to go to counseling, and if the situation does 
not improve, he can be kicked out of the Technion. This is despite the fact 
that the Technion-wide tests' score average is 70%. 

Luckily for me, at an average of 80-82%, I was well above this limitation, and 
so were most people I know. One thing I decided to do was never to improve my 
grade if it was a passing one. I have a few grades below 60%, but had enough 
grades in the 80's-90's-100 range to compensate for them. I know some people 
who are the oppposite extreme, including one that is not satisfied with a 
grade below 94% and finished his undergraduate degree in Computer Science 
with an average of close to 95% (but slightly below). OTOH, he's a bit of a 
strange bird.

I had worked before I joined the Technion as a programmer in several 
companies, so I'm familiar with it. I used to like it a lot better than 
studying. It was actually very enjoyable to work - very enlightening and 
rewarding. (not necessarily financially rewarding). 

As for me, I did not as much became bored with my studies (except for 
hour-by-hour or day-by-day boredom) as much as became _irritated_ with the 
process. If things were better, I would have had a steady load of challenging 
homework followed by relatively easy tests at the end of the semester. That 
way people who studied hard throughout the semester would have easily passed, 
and students who slacked off, would not have fared well anyway. But as it is, 
the tests can be incredibly unfair - either too hard, too long or completely 
out of context. Many times various factors are used to improve the grade. (as 
a symptomatic cure). This makes studying a lot more unexpected, and less 
something that you know that you can easily pass by investing some work.

I have many other musings to tell about the Technion if you'd be interested 
and also have some links for previous places where I expressed it.

Hmmm... I believe this brings us back to the dictatorship of the majority or 
Franklin's "two wolves and a lamb" argument. Can a majority violate the 
invididual rights of the minority? It cannot and must not.

Hmmm... well personally, I would have more trust in a few competing, 
_voluntary_ private welfare systems. Other than that, Neo-Tech says 
somewhere, that a person must make sure he would be supportive of himself in 
his old age, without help from the government. Plus, it also advocates the 
development of Youth-Rejuvanating Biological Immortality, which, if it 
becomes common, may solve the entire old age problem all-together.

Well, Muslims and Christian Arabs don't need to serve in the Army. (they can 
volunteer to do so, though). Druze Arabs do have a mandatory service in the 
Army, as the Druze community in Israel decided that, as in other countries 
they live in, they will be loyal to the country in which they live. 
Ironically, the ratio of young men there who decide not to cheat their way 
out of the army there, is much higher than among the Jews.

Moreover, many Yeshiva students and other Orthodox Jews also become exempt 
from service, even though this is theoretically illegal. They also receive 
some kind of state service (I forget which one) to which only people who 
served in the army, or people who were found to be disqualified do, and which 
the Muslim/Christian Arabs do not receive.

I was disqualified from the service due to my Psychological problems. Many 
people simulate such problems to become disqualified, and in general some 
people assume I'm a "mishtameth", someone who evaded service. At that time, I 
actually wanted to serve in the army. But I don't know if the reportedly bad 
army service is worse than a series of severe depressions or anxieties such 
as the ones I used to be in.

FWIW, I support making the army completely voluntary. I have a link explaining 
my reasons.

OK. On another personal note, I got two articles published on O'Reilly Net to 
which I received $200 and $300 respectively. This gives me some financial 
room to manuever until I find a job. The articles are:

"Solving Puzzles with LM-Solve"
http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/11/17/lmsolve.html

LM-Solve is a solver I wrote in Perl for certain types of Logic Mazes that I 
found on the Net. In this article, I demonstrated how to extend it to solve 
another puzzle. Because of Perl's dynamic and "interpreted" nature, one can 
do it just by editing a text file and then running it with the Perl 
interpreter. (no compilation is required).

"The New Breed of Version Control Systems"
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2004/01/29/scm_overview.html

I've told you about the so-called "version control systems", or "source 
control systems" before. So I think you should read at least the first parts 
of the article which fully explain what it's all about.

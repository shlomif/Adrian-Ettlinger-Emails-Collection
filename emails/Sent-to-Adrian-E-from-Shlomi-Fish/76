Hi Adrian!

What's up? You haven't responded to my last E-mail. I also requested that you 
pack the complete Freecell Pro and also test it on your computer to see that 
it compils.

Please read the enlosed message for a letter I sent to my former boss about 
why I quitted. So now I'm unemployed again, but I have a few job leads and 
also have some stuff to keep me occupied.

Regards,

	Shlomi Fish

Hi Gabor!

I hereby announce my resignation from PTI, and no longer wish to work as its 
employee. Note that in accordance with my contract, I agree to continue to 
work up to one month from this announcement, and afterwards will also answer 
any questions that you have about the code. (free of charge). I believe my 
code is of good quality, with meaningful identifiers. While it does not have 
a lot of comments or POD, it should be easy for you or any other clueful 
developer to get the hang of. If not, I am willing to explain what's going on 
there, with no additional price.

The rest of the message will describe the reasons that I decided to resign, so 
hopefully you can understand why I quit and think about it.

First of all let me note that I have a great respect for you as a honest and 
friendly person who has been doing a lot of good things for himself and other 
people. I also have a high respect you as an engineer, and expert in Perl and 
other technologies. (Despite the fact that I many times found the solutions 
or strategies you choose for various problems heavily sub-optimal.)

Now for the reasons:

1. What I did was not Exciting or Challenging Enough
----------------------------------------------------

The stuff I did for Gisha was interesting and I learned many new technologies. 
But I didn't find it particularly challenging or exciting. Doing Perl/Web/SQL 
work is something I did in the past and that I cannot get myself to become 
excited about. E-commerce is also not particularly exciting most of the time. 
It was not particularly challenging either.

Things I'd like to do are:

1. Something hardware-related like VHDL/Verilog, Embedded Software, writing 
Device Drivers or otherwise software that interacts with hardware, or Signal 
Processing.

2. Systems Programming - working on serious large-scale systems with many 
interesting algorithms. Usually (but not always) these things are not written 
in Perl, but increasingly they are. Since I know C and C++ and to some extent 
Java, I can also work on such stuff. While I find such languages more tedious 
to work with than Perl, I still find working on such code more exciting.

The Shear Networks project (which you introduced me to) seemed like good 
systems programming, but unfortunately they got bogged down in politics.

As a consultant, it seems you're not doing too much of this, and I'd also 
prefer a more permanent job with an office on a long-term project.

2. The Pay was Bad
------------------

I am a Technion Graduate in EE, with a lot of knowledge and experience, and 
with good throughput and quality of code. Many workplaces will offer a 
candidate such as I a flat salary of 14,000 NIS per Month (or at least 10,000 
NIS), with a nice office, where I have less distractions, and with co-workers 
I can consult or brain-storm with. They also won't monitor the net time that 
I actually spend working, and be perfectly happy with my large throughput 
despite the fact that the Net amount I spend on working is usually a small 
percent. For more of this, see Joel Spolsky's "Fire and Motion":

http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000339.html

When I asked you for a flat pay (even 10,000 NIS) you said I should be much 
more productive. But most people who work for 10,000 NIS or even 14,000 NIS 
don't spend so large a percentage of their time actually writing code. (as 
Joel notes). Plus, this time is also spent thinking, planning, and designing 
the code, that is also important besides raw coding.

3. I felt Guilty for not Working
--------------------------------

I actually felt guilty for not working instead of doing much more enjoyable 
things like working on FOSS, tending to my homepage, writing essays and 
articles, writing E-mails, and doing other productive, but things that bring 
less positive cash flow. If the work was enjoyable, I wouldn't have felt very 
guilty.

Neo-Tech has a lot to say about guilt, and how a person can become guiltless. 
"Feeling Good" also dedicates an entire chapter to overcoming feelings of 
guilt. I don't recall feeling very guilty at other works I did.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sorry, but I don't think that PTI is big enough for me. What I plan to do 
instead is:

1. I'd like to get an Independent Status from the Government, and be able to 
use it to work as a consultant, contractor, private tutor, etc. It's high 
time I did.

2. I'm going to publicise the fact that I'm looking for a job in a prominent 
place on my homesite. I'm also going to publicise the various ways in which I 
can get hired (consultant, contractor, private tutor, etc.). I'm also going 
to proactively look for a job.

3. I'm going to make some money writing articles for O'ReillyNet and possibly 
other online publications. I'm also going to publish a lot of stuff on my 
home site, where I can make some money off Google Ads and PayPal Donations.

4. I'm going to work on open source software, which will add to my experience, 
and which will bring me more publicity.

5. I'm going to tend to the presentation and content aspects of my home site 
and my other sites, to make them better and more accessible.

6. Hopefully I can also get my winapt project to take off. I'll probably need 
to finance a VMWare licence, but that would be doable in time.

---------------------------------------

Note that this is not a rash decision. I consulted Ori Idan and Sagiv Barhoom 
about it on the phone, and also thought about it a lot. This is what I want 
to do, and I'm sorry that you hiring me did not live to my standards. There 
were other aspects of the job that I did like, but it's still not good enough 
for me.

Sincerely Yours,

	Shlomi Fish

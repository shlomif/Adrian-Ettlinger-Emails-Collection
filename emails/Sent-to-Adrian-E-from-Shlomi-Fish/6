Ah, interesting. I may have liked something similar.

You probably meant Jewish cuisine, as the modern State of Israel dates to w=

Well, I recall something about Israel assassinating a prominent Hamas leade=
r,
and the Hamas retaliated, but really the Hamas has been breaking many
ceasefires for a long time.

Naturally, I don't expect the Iron Dome system (or most anything in the
physical world) to be 100% effective. See:

I think it goes through the Egyptian (through Sinai) land connection. I thi=
nk
the egyptian authorities don't patrol Sinai too closely (in part due to the
peace agreement with Israel that declared Sinai a demilitariased zone).

I'm still looking for a job if you can give me some leads. I have a few lee=

and some E-mails and job interviews, but nothing final yet.

I'm glad to hear from you again.

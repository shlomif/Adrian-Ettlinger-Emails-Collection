So maybe I did not stress this fact enough. But one obviously needs to know=

I'd like to put it put this in a small box saying "Note" in the body of the=

Yes, I heard of it. Someone told us about it in the recent meeting of the T=

Aviv Linux Club. I'm not sure if it qualifies as a major event. It's possib=

a medium event.

I'm not worried about him. He will return. They (=3D Israeli Politicians) a=

OK. Iraq is a seriously messed up country. I didn't trust Saddam Hussein ba=

at the time. I'm sure he kept a lot of weapons and did not destroy them lik=

he told, but who knows where they are now. (Syria? Iran?) Obviously,=20

too much beforehand. The Iraqi's regime was not a threat as an advocate of=

terrorism, but rather as being a violent, "exceptionally" irrational regime.

I'm not sure what's the best course of action as far as the U.S. is concern=

Right. I did my best to explain what I read in the book to you. But there's=

Well, like I said Jaynes gives a lot of evidence to support his claims. He=
=20
covers the origins of Human societies and civilization since the end of the=
=20
last Ice Age, (at least as relevant to what he wants to say) and shows how =
it=20
fits his theory. He also gives a lot of evidence from contemporary studies =
of=20
the brain's mental processes.=20

Despite that, many researchers still not agree with Jaynes, or think there =
may=20
be other explanations. According to the Wikipedia, the controversy of the=20
book and the fact that he chose to publish it as a pop-science book, sort o=
f=20
overshadowed most of his other achivements, which were numerous:

I don't know what Jaynes had to say about it, and he might be somewhat=20
avoiding discussing this in the early edition I have and read. (according t=
o=20
Wikipedia, later editions have some expansions).

OK.

Now here's some more fuel for future conversation. First of all, my father=
=20
recently downloaded some funny and insightful quotes about idea generation =
by=20
Einstein and other people. Here they are for your amusement:

Great spirits have often encountered violent opposition from weak minds.

Great ideas often receive violent opposition from mediocre minds.

Other than that, there's this well-known man in the programming world named=
=20
Paul Graham. (http://www.paulgraham.com/) He wrote a few books about the LI=
SP=20
programming language, started his own start-up company which used LISP to=20
write a site that allows people to set up their own online shops and which=
=20
was eventually sold to Yahoo, and recently started writing a lot of essays=
=20
about computing, business, and other topics. (For which people primarily he=
ar=20
about him again).

In his essays, he often has several interesting ideas or insights. There ar=
e a=20
few I'd like to mention here.

=46rom his essay "Great Hackers" (http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html) he say=
s=20
that:

<<<
"The people I've met who do great work... generally feel that
 they're stupid and lazy, that their brain only works properly
 one day out of ten, and that it's only a matter of time until
 they're found out."
>>>

(I couldn't find this particular quote in the current version of the essay.=
 It=20
seem to have mysteriously disappeared. You can still find it here:

http://web.archive.org/web/20040728182546/http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html
)

I'm a bit ambivalent about that quote, but I do often feel that I don't get=
 as=20
much work as I should. Often, I also feel that everything I do that doesn't=
=20
involve writing actual (Turing-Complete) code of programs' "doesn't count",=
=20
and so I'm not satisfied unless I do some coding.

He recently also wrote an essay "What Business can learn from open-source?":

http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html

In it he talks about how people writing things in their homes, at their fre=
e=20
times doing what they like, etc. (like people who write blogs or work on op=
en=20
source) can surpass the offering of a commercial business. Graham says an=20
office in a software company tends to be a sterile environment, which tends=
=20
to discourage creativity, and so forth. He then goes on to say that the=20
employer-employee relationship is similar a parent-child or a master-slave=
=20
one. This is while an investor and the companies he invests in, is more lik=
e=20
equals.

My friend identified in his blog entry=20
( http://www.livejournal.com/users/tddpirate/28141.html ) that what Graham=
=20
says does not apply to non-software companies which have hardware that need=
s=20
to be operated by professionals: chip fabs, ships, car assembly plants,=20
airline companies.

Another thing I feel about it is that at work I've often felt more dedicate=
d=20
to doing actual work. There were fewer diversions, and about one task that =
I=20
knew I had to do, while being there. At home I tend to divert my attention=
=20
among lots of different things. While I often procrastinated at work, I was=
=20
still more focused and achieved more. Also at a workplace, one can talk wit=
h=20
one's employees, get some ideas from them etc. It's hard to communicate whe=
n=20
you're several kilometers apart. (even with all due respect to the=20
technological advancement.)

=46inally, in one of his essays ( http://www.paulgraham.com/essay.html ) he=
=20
mentions that it is a good idea to be interested in history - "but social a=
nd=20
economic history, not political history.". I tend to agree with him that=20
political history is relatively unimportant. It's full of who conquered who=
=20
when and where, and nothing too much besides. I still remember a lot of thi=
s=20
political history facts, but luckily forgot most of them.

I do know that the books I've read that described the social and economic=20
history, were often very interesting. I still don't feel like I've read=20
enough of that.

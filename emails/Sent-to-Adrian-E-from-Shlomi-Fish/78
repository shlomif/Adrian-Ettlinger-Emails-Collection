Hi all!

Fresh from my press is this open letter to the California governor. It's 
written in HTML, so feel free to read and comment. It may be a little 
redundant, but still relevant.

Note to the Americans: please report any style or grammatical error you find 
to me. (assuming you review it of course)

Note that a necessary pre-requisite for this letter is to finish translating 
the "Check the Facts" campaign to English:

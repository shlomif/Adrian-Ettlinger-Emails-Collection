Hi Shlomi,

    I like Indian food myself also.  In fact, most "ethnic" cuisines.  It's
interesting how Mexican food finds its way around the world.  I have a
friend who lived in Bahrain for quite a while, and he explained the presence
of Mexican restaurants there by the fact that there is a big US naval base
there.  The explanation for Israel might be that so many Americans have
moved or visited there.  Hmmm.  Wonder if there are any, or many, Mexican
restaurants in France.  Probably are in Italy and Germany because of the US
military bases there.

    I should bring you up to date on where I stand. with FcPro and FCS
2.6.1.  My objective has been to decide and implement how I want it to work
when the hot key is used to invoke FCS by a player checking out an
intermediate position.  The question is what strategy to employ to minimize,
on the average, the wait time for a reliable verdict.  We need to find a
protocol which will be a compromise between highest speed and reliability,
with the requirement that this mode will never (so far as we know) deliver a
false impossible verdict.  And it has to meet that objective not only when
playing with four freecells, but also with fewer down to zero.  To that end,
I did some extensive testing over the past few days at four down to zero
freecells.  I had to repeat some of the testing because of the realization
that my first round was done without the prelude mode functioning.  I want
to report to you my findings, because I think they might contribute to your
direction of further development once you return to working on FCS (I note
your comment that you will be suspending further work on FCS for a while).

    I do find that FCS is much, much slower under an atomic move preset.  In
fact, competitively with Patsolve, it is on the whole considerably slower.
But at the same time, it is faster at finding a solution under a non-atomic
preset for the great majority of positions for which it can find a solution
quickly.  But this advantage declines as one reduces the number of
freecells.  In fact, at zero freecells, the best atomic move preset is, on
the average, faster than the best non-atomic-move preset.  At one freecell,
non-atomic is definitely faster, but atomic is often very, very slow.  At
zero freecells,  there seems to be a greater tendency for false impossibles
with a non-atomic preset.  Here are some examples you might want to look at
later:

    With one freecell, deal #90, which is impossible.  With atomic preset,
FCS takes 234 seconds to reach the impossible verdict, Patsolve takes only
19 seconds.

    With zero freecells, two deals which show "Impossible" with a non-atomic
preset, but are winnable with atomic, are #3178 and #7167,  With #7167, FCS
is much slower, with atomic, in finding the solution than is Patsolve.  FCS
takes several seconds, Patsolve appears almost instantaneous.

    My one remaining project before I post 2.6.1 on my website is to install
a protocol for the FCS hot key operation.  I'm going to make is so, if in
the zero freecell game, it will use the best atomic move preset.  For one
freecell and above, it will use first the non-atomic move preset, and stay
in that mode for as long as the FcPro-set limitation either as to time or
iterations allows, and if a win if found, will then exit.  But if
intractable or impossible under the non-atomic move preset, it will then
spend an equal amount of time working under an atomic move preset.

    There's a suggestion here for your next development of the preset
system.  I'd suggest you have an optional mode under which, for a
multiple-line preset, it does not deliver any impossible verdicts if the
line is a non-atomic move one, and accepts an impossible verdict only from
an atomic move line.

    I hope to complete my work in the next day or two, maybe if I'm lucky
even yet this morning (we have some family visiting going on and I'm up
early to get some work done before the activity starts, which will eat up
the rest of the day).

Best regards,  -------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Moving on.  In my insomniac mode.  Awake after about three hours sleep,
and looking for something to do.  Creative writing is a good outlet.

    On the personal front, I've had an atypical past couple of months.  The
first week of July was a major railroad history convention in Baltimore, at
which I had a great time making a number of new contacts.  Then, immediately
after that, I entered a hospital for hip replacement surgery.  Don't recall
if I had told you about my arthritic hip, so bear with me if this includes
some repitition.  Back in 1965, I was in an automobile accident, where I
sustained a hip fracture that had to be repaired with surgery (two screws).
The surgeon at that time told me I'd very likely develop arthritis in that
hip.  He was right, but the good news was it took 37 years to develop.
Then, about 15 months ago, it really started getting painful.  Physical
therapy helped it quite a bit last year, but doctors kept saying it can only
get worse, never better, and it was wearing me down enough that a few months
ago I decided to have the surgery.  I'm still recovering, but over the worst
of it.  Walkiing with a cane, and I'm not yet even back to where I was
before the surgery, but that's mainly due to weakness in the leg, which
seems to be improving day by day, as I'm finally now at the point where I
can walk reasonable distances with a cane for exercise.

    And, further news, right now I'm in the first day of a week-long stay
with my extended family in a rented house near the beach on Cape Cod.  In
fact, I timed the surgery so I'd be just enough well-recovered that I'd be
able to make this trip.  One good thing about being with my extended family
is that my son and daughter-in-law are both atheists, and fairly well
ediucated, intelligent and articulate on the subject, and I want to try out
some ideas on them for the purposes of the next section of this reply that I
still have to work on.  In addition, one of my grandsons, 11 years old, is
being put through some Catholic educaiton, and he knows the ten commandments
by heart.  He's also a bright kid and I think might be able to contribute
something to the discussion.  He of course is not a child of my son's, but
of my daughter's.  I may have mentioned to you what's going on in my
daughter's family.  She married a Catholic (Paul), a fellow who is really
"lapsed" and doesn't take religion seriously at all.  But they live in a
community and see a lot of Paul's relatives, who are all observing
Catholics, at least they go to church every Sunday.  So all the kid's
cousins are going through Catholic education, and my daughter (really more
than her husband) thought it best to send the kids to Catholic religious
education so they wouldn't be outcasts among their cousins.  The 11-year-old
son has stuck with it, but the 8-year old daughter, also very bright and
strong-willed as well, decided to quit, saying "What's the point?"   I've
tried to engage her in religious discussion, but she really has no interest
in talking about it.  She says she believes in God, but she doesn't have any
interest in talking about what that means or listening to anyone who wants
to instruct her about what to think, including both Catholic priests and me.
They have another son, age 6 now, and it'll be interesting to see how he
reacts.  I'm inclined to think he'll be rebellious also.

    When I move on to section 3, the Shlomi brand of atheism, I'll want to
explore in greater depth your "peculiar" attitude toward "alttrusim", and
also discuss in greater depth the differences between the rationalization of
religious attitudes in the environment of the US vs. Israel.  That's going
to be very demanding to express my thoughts clearly.  And it probably will
take another day to get to.

Best regards, -----------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I'm sorry I wasn't able to get my earlier message, just dispatched a few
minutes ago, out to you last night so you would have had it first thing in
the morning.  But I'll go ahead anyway expanding on part of it.

    You and I having been talking for quite a while without dealing at all
with the problem your nation faces.  I've wondered how appropriate it is for
us to discuss this.  For instance, I'm not so sure to what extent freedom of
speech really prevails over there.  I'd be hesitant even here about
expressing ideas that political zealots here in the US might consider
"treasonous".  Who knows who is snooping and reading our E-mail?

    But I'll take a chance and let you know exactly what is my perspective.
First, I'll say that whenever I hear of a terrorist incident in Haifa, the
back of my mind says "I hope Shlomi wasn't in that neighborhood."

    When I look at Israel's situation, the question has to come up "Whose
fault is it?".  Well, my attitude is that the fault lies partly on both
sides, and it rests with the extremists on both sides.  On balance, most of
the fault is with the Palestinians.  But a substantial part of it is with
the Israelis also.  One possible solution, which would require much
patience, would be for Israel to become completely "dovish", i. e. the
approach that was being tried by the Labor party.  But, one way to put it,
the amount of patience that would take is probably more than any population
could be expected to be able to exercise.  So, whenever it was a few years
ago, the public opinion there swung over to taking the impatient approach,
and first Netanyahu and the Sharon were elected.  We can't say it looks, up
to this point, that this approach is "working."

    Re the settlements, you and I probably agree that the most serious and
destructive act that the extremists on the Israeli side have committed has
been the construction of the settlements.  That has created a geographic
situation which makes a solution almost impossible.  One thought I've had is
that whatever ultimate solution is going to come about, it's going to take
the pouring of a lot of concrete.  The geographic intermingling of the two
peoples is such that even if a Palestinian state were to be created, there
are so many points of contact because of the distribution of the settlements
that it would be impossible for peaceful coexistence to be maintained.  So,
let's assume money was no problem, what might be done?  By pouring enough
concrete, a system of isolated, protected roads could be built linking all
the settlements, with bridges and tunnels at frequent intervals to also
connect all the otherwise isolated areas of the Palestinian state.  That is,
with a hugely expensive construction project, you could create an
infrastructure so that the two states would be in effect continguuous with
freedom of travel between all parts, yet enough isolation to avoid friction.
It might even need to include a tunnel or elevated highway between Gaza and
the West Bank.  That of course is a fantastic and not very likely
construction project, and is hardly likely ever to happen.

    There's another possibility, also requiring a lot of concrete.  You have
said that if the settlements could all be evacuated, the residents could all
move into the contguous area of Israel.  I don't really know that much about
the geography there, but is that really practical?  Is there enough room in
contiguous Israel for the population of the settlements to find places to
live?  Whatever, a lot of buildings would have to be built.  But is there
enough empty real estate on which to locate all those buildings?  This leads
to another thought, also expensive.  I don't know what the population
figures are, but what is the population of the settlements, and then, what
is the population of the Gaza strip?  The isolation of Gaza from the West
Bank is also a problem. Why not swap the territory of the settlements for
the territory of Gaza, and exchange the populations?  That, on the face of
it, would not be equitable from the Israeli viewpoint, because you'd be
handing over, I'm quite sure, some very nice living quarters for what I
assume is probably a slum.  So it might require tearing down all the
buildings in Gaza and replacing them with something much nicer.

   There's more I could say, but that's enough for the time being.  I'll be
interested in hearing your reaction.

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    First, a little preamble. When I wrote this morning, I felt somewhat
discouraged because of the way I'd left the program overnight.  I'd gotten
it so that it would play your solution to #144713 without an illegal move,
but I'd made it worse for other boards.  Starting with #1, which had
previously played OK, it now had an illegal move.  Well, I now have that
fixed, and in a way I am changing my internals to match your move
repertoire.  That particular problem was from the fact that enabling FcPro's
supermove for replaying your moves made matters worse, for the reason that
you are not following FcPro's supermove rules when moving a stack to an
empty stack.  Fortunately, I have a separate function for moving a stack to
an empty vs. an occupied stack, so I was able to leave supermove disabled in
the function that moves to an empty stack, and that solved that particular
problem.

    I'm now starting to work my way through the boards which produce illegal
moves, to see in what other ways your moves differ from mine.  This is to
report the next one I've found.  A file is attached for game #2 explaining.
The problem here is entirely different, and, frankly, I think somewhat
silly.  You allow aces to reside in freecells.  I can see the likelihood
that this is probably only the tip of an iceberg, because both M/S Freecell
and FcPro not only automatically post aces to the foundation, but also post
any other cards whose posting meets a certain rule, i. e., that the card can
serve no purpose if left on a stack or a freecell.  It might be that this
will prove to be the problem in the remaining cases, but so far I haven't
looked past #2.  I'm working with boards from the lowest numbers up rather
than using the list you had sent.

    If you change your move rules to account for the automatic posting as
done in M/S Freecell, it would reduce the number of moves in your solutions,
and make your optimization look even better than it now looks.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

#2 (FCPro - FCSolve debug)
1h 4a 4b 4h 5c 5h 4d c4 d6 5c 
5d a5 c8 5a 5c b5 c7 a7 2b 2c 
2a d2
The third move back here, "2c",
evidently is intended by FCS to
place an Ace (of diamonds) on a
Freecell.  Otherwise, the last
move above, "d2" will not be valid.
Both in FcPro and in M/S Freecell,
Aces are automatically posted to
the foundation.

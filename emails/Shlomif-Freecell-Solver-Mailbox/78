Hi Shlomi,

    I get the general idea, but this amounts to a project that's likely to
take me at least a couple of days work, and I was looking for something I
wouldn't have to spend more than about an hour on.

    Nevertheless, let's proceed to firm up the spec.  Then, at a minimum, I
might give you some coaching on how to do it.  I see the visible part of the
list box is names the user will assign to presets.  Where do the presets
come from?  Do you want the user to be able to compose the content of the
presets?  Or will you provide the data for them?  What is the format of each
individual preset?   You had originally given a number of 64K.  What does
this represent? The full data capacity of the entire list of presets?

<<Or I will take over this maintainance...>>
    I'd be delighted at that prospect myself.

<<But let's focus on the problems at hand and this is integrating FCS and
patsolve into FC-Pro. >>
    I fully agree.  The previous notion is for later discussion.

<<Did you already upgrade to Freecell Solver 2.0.0? It will be a necessary
pre-requisite for the presets stuff.>>
    No I haven't, and that much I'd like to proceed with.  To make it
easiest for me, may I ask you to send me a zipped (NOT gzipped) file
containing just the source modules I need for the purpose?

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

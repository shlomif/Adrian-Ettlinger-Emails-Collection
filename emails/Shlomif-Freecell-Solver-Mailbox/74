Section 2b: "You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under
the terms of this License."

True, the "terms of this License" doesn't specifically mean the GPL, but
only one that is compatible with it, i.e., one that has the same "terms".

So, yes, FC-Pro doesn't have to be GPL specifically, but it does have to
be covered by a license that contains the terms of the GPL.  Sorry for the
confusion.  I misinterpreted your original "doesn't have to be under the
GPL" statement.  What license do you recommend?

What are you talking about?  The situation under discussion is: FC-Pro
running vs. linking with Patsolve (a GPL program).  Section 0 says anybody
can RUN a GPL program, it says NOTHING about what GPL programs can RUN.
And it's "proprietary".

This means only that any derivative of bash must be GPLed (or equivalent).
The GPL makes specific exceptions for required parts of the OS, libraries,
C compiler, etc.  You can, for example, compile bash on an IRIX system
that uses proprietary libraries.  To repeat: that's a specific exception
granted by the GPL (section 3).  So you're right, it's not that viral.
This is also irrelevant.

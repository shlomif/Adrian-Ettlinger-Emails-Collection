Hi Shlomi,

    First, the good news.  As far as I can tell from the three false
impossible examples I have to work with, the atomic moves option seems to be
working as it should.  I even reran the entire test of c. 25,000 positions,
and it went through with no problems.  I'm satisfied now to post 2.6.1 on my
site, but I have a little more work I want to do to take advantage of it.

    For the "hot key" mode that players use to check intermediate positions,
I want to set up a compound mode so that it first uses a "fast" non-atomic
preset (like Abra Kadabra), and only if that produces an Impossible verdict,
will it invoke an atomic preset.  I do find that the fastest atomic preset
is much, much slower than Abra Kadabra.  My benchmark test is to run the
first 1000 deals.  Abra Kadabra works through that range in 31 or 32
seconds, while the fastest atomic preset takes over 4 minutes.

    But heres one thing about the performance of various presets which seems
to me at variance with what I recall you having said.  I see that your Abra
Kadabra preset has the same "method" lines as your previous "best"
non-atomic preset.  That' the same one I'd sent you a copy of when you
wondered what preset I was using that was resulting in crashes.  I. e., the
only difference is that the "prelude" option is added.  Well, I don't see
any difference in performance between the preset with and without the
"prelude".  Both presets go through the first 1000 deals in about 31-32
seconds. Does that sound right?

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

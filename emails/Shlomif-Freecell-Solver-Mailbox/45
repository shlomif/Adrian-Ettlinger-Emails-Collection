Hi Shlomi,

    Thought I'd better break off from my efforts to get a message off to
you, even though this probably won't get to you until about midnight
Saturday night your time.  I'd better get these points recorded anyway,
while they're fresh in mind.  The last point will bring up what might be a
serious problem.

    Firstly, when I first got to the new laptop, thought I'd take the time
first to see what happens with that Big Intractable, #9.  It ran for about a
half-hour without either trapping out on an interation overflow or a full
disk.  This was on an 850Mhz laptop with around 0.8 GB of available disk
space.  This leads me to wonder if you possibly could have a condition
which, with this board, causes some kind of a perpetual loop, so I thought
you might want to use your diagnostic tools to see if you can figure out
what's happening with this board.

    I then did a little bit of further general testing, and "The good news"
is that Freecell Solver certainly can produce some much shorter solutions
than FcPro.  I tried that well-known "hard hand", #1941, and FcPro's
solution took 223 moves, and FCS, in A* optimized, gave a solution of 49
moves.  Very good.

    Now for the not-so-good news.  I'm somewhat hung up getting the solver
replays to use Supermove.  It's more complicated than I'd hoped.  With more
mental elbow-grease, I'm fairly sure I'll get it, but not yet.  But in the
course of my testing, I stumbled across, by serendipity, an indication that
this is not going to fix it.  It might make it better, so I'll keep on
working on it.  But...  Here's what happened.  I was trying to work on
#144713, the first one you reported.  I goofed and accidently spent a lot of
time on #114713 instead.  But this might have been a blessing in disguise,
because #114713, I found, produces an illegal move at one place because
supermove is being used, whereas it would get past that place if supermove
were disabled.  I'm attaching a file which explains the problem.

    So I'd really like to know to what extent you or anyone else has tested
the solutions you deliver by playing them out manually.  I must say, and
I'll be very happy to be proved wrong, that at this moment it looks to me as
if your solutions can only be played out on a special version of Freecell
designed expressly to make compound moves according to specialized rules.
Tell me if I'm wrong.

    If you've sent an messages to me since my last, I'll see them when I log
on to send this, and will reply immediately in a separate message.

Best regards,  -------------------Adrian

This last move (43) seems to be
intended to move just one card,
the six of spades, to column 3.
With supermove enabled both the
seven of hearts and the six
will move, so the following
move will be illegal.

Hi Shlomi,

    Re the Technion site, I can now access it again this morning.  But all
day yesterday, into late at night, it appeared to be down.  No doubt a
problem somewhere else in the Internet system.  I don't know that much about
how Internet is structured, but it must be that the Technion site, to be
accessed from my part of the US (or maybe from North America?) requires some
other server to be up and running, and that other server was down.  Or part
of a telephone system somewhere on the route being down.  Although I would
have thought that any point-to-point route in Internet would have many
alternate paths it could use.  Do you know anything about this?

    Anyway, now that you've sent me the source (and it will be more
convenient having it in a file that includes only what I will really need),
I'll get to work on it right away.

    Working my way through your messages:

<<10350 - it is solveable with three freecells, but after 1,208,363
iterations. Are you sure it is the correct number?>>
    Yes, that's the right number.  And this does mean that, in the computer
I was using, it fits the definition of "Intractable".  Because that
particular computer, with "only" 270MB of available hard drive space, cannot
run long enough to achieve a result, at least using your normal DFS mode.
The definition of Intractable depends upon the memory available in the given
computer, or upon an arbitrary "impatience" setting.  I. e., if we want to
do a run, for the purpose of testing a solver, over a range of boards, we
want to cover as many boards as we can in a reasonable period of time, so we
might not want to solver to continue working on a board that might tie it up
for a long period on time (10 minutes?  4 hours?).  So we'd run the range
with a limitation either of time, or iterations.  I did very extensive
testing of the FcPro solver in that way.  It would  produce a results file
that would identify the Intractables (usually my settings were such that
there were very few). Then I would go back to those Intractables and look
for a way to solve them by using some other mode in the solver.

    BTW, I was not using my most powerful laptop for this test.  This one is
400 mHz, 160 MB RAM, with, as I said, only about 270 MB of hard drive space
available.  I could also run it in my new 850 mHz, 256 MB RAM, 8 GB
available hard drive space machine.  I'm going to do that, because I'm
curious to see how long it takes.

    Thanks for the info about the alternate site ("berlioz") from where the
source could have been downloaded.  Yesterday, in my desperation, I did a
Google search on your name, and on Freecell, and found many, many hits, but
didn't systematically explore them all.  If I had, I probably would have
found that site.  I also did a search on Technion, and dispelled some of my
ignorance about the institution.  I see you are in Haifa.  And that you are
also a Linux "expert", among other things.  And a movie reviewer. :-)  What
is your position at the university?  You're involved in so much, I somehow
doubt that you are a student.   I also researched time zones and found out
that you are only two hours east of London, so I figured out the 7 hour
difference.  Question:  Could Technion be described as the "MIT of Israel."?

    From your later message, I see that your "iterations" count is a sort of
"macro-hands", in relation to our terminology in the FcPro solver.  I.e. one
of your iterations could be several of our "hands" counts.  With regard to
depth, as a recursion count, it's possible that this would have the same
significance as the "depth" count in FcPro.  It might take some
experimentation to determine this, but the question would be whether, if you
run it in a memory-starved environment, and you want to avoid the
possibility that a board requring a very long run will cause the computer to
stop because the hard drive is full, would it be possible to set a limit on
depth so that the solver would stop before it hit that limit?  Actually, in
FcPro, we carry that a step further and test for available hard drive space,
and set that limit automatically.  This grew out of extensive testing and
wanting to have a "product" that would not annoy users who were running it
in small lightweight computer environments.  But this is a level of
sophistication in the design that we can defer to be tackled later on.

    Thanks for the tutoring on pointers.

<<C++ is mostly a superset of C.>>
    That's what I've always assumed.  You sent me a second copy of the
interface code, with the file extension of  ".c", but you didn't say whether
this was the same file, renamed.  Whatever, I'll use the second one you
sent.

<<Do you mean BFS as in "Best-First Search" or "Breadth-First Search"?
Unless I completely misinterpreted Justin Heyes-Jones A* tutorial, my A*
implementation is indeed A*.>>
    I did mean Best First, using Bill Raymond's nomenclature.  Raymond's
behavior at times seems so eccentric that I don't necessarily take his
comments all that seriously.  I might or might not continue that dialogue
with him.  My inclination is to trust you more than I do him.

    As you put it to Mike Keller:
<<I meant that it is possible that some states that can be solved, will be
reported as unsolveable by it. So, there will be some false negatives.>>
    If that means what it seems to mean, I'm somewhat diappointed.  Does
that mean you do not intend to achieve a solver that will be "perfect" in
terms of providing a solution for every board for which a solution is
possible?  That's what I've been hoping will be developed some day, the pot
at the end of the rainbow.  But even an "imperfect" Freecell Solver might
still be "better" than what we now have in FcPro, because we are hardly
"perfect" either.

    My working time today is going to be restricted, so don't know how far
I'll get.  This is the Thanksgiving holiday here (as maybe you were aware)
and we're meeting with my daughter's family, including three grandkids, this
afternoon for the traditional Turkey dinner, at a resturant across the
river.

Best regards, --------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I hadn't been meaning to neglect our conversation.

    In asking my Jewish atheist friend (who worked in Israel for two years
some time ago) what he could tell me about what it going on now regarding
possible abolition of the Ministry of Religion, he told me he hasn't really
followed things that closely, but there were a couple of interesting points
he made.

    He used the expression "Separation of synagogue and state".  I've been
meaning to ask him if that's a common expression.  Have you ever heard that
used in Israel?  It is, of course, adopted from a very common expression in
the US "Separation of church and state."  In fact I am a member, and a
vice-president of a local chapter of an organization by the name of
"Americans United for Separation of Church and State".  The issues that are
fought over in the US are very, very different, however, from any such
issues as they would be in Israel.

    Another thing he mentioned.  In that story about a possible shift in
emphasis in Sharon's government, he mentioned the same political party which
had been mentioned in the article as (then) pending for inclusion in the
government.  The Shinui Party.  My friend describes this as a very
anti-religious party.  It sounds as if this party contains many people who
think exactly as you do.  Are you very well acquainted with this party?

    Another point he mentioned is that Sharon himself is not a very
religious person.  That might well explain the remarks I heard Sharon make
which almost seemed defensive as to his pride in his Jewish heritage.  That
raises the thought that, whatever else one feels about Sharon's policies, he
could be a leader in a movement to further the secularization of Israel.
Unfortunately, he has some other rather demanding distractions he has to be
concerned with.

    There is still some further conversation we could have on a more
philosophical level, but I don't have a lot of time to write more at the
moment, so I'll just leave the subject matter of this message confined to
politics.

Best regards, --------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<<Don't you think we should release a version of FC-Pro with both FCS and
patsolve integrated before we do that? One cow at a time...>>
    In general, that's the spirit in which I like to operate.  But I must
tell you that up until that message from you, I was interpreting your
reactions as to my suggestions of releasing FcPro V6.5 as being one of
reluctance. So I went off to work on some ancillary questions that had
attracted my interest.  Now that I have momentum on the 8-9 freecell change,
I'd like to follow it through.  My next priority then will be to integrate
your new version 2.0.  Then we can take it from there.  I think I'm on the
last stages of the 8-9 freecall mods.

Best regards,  -------------Adrian

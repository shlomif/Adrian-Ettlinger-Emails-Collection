Hi Shlomi,

    There were two distinct places in your last message which raised a "red
flag", i. e., which stood out as calling for more explanation and/or
discussion.

    The first is this:
<<I don't mind people believing in God. It's not my objective to eliminate
the belief in God.>>
    But when this discussion first started, it appeared to me that your
primary aim was to prosyletize for atheism, i. e., to convert as many people
as you could to atheism.  What I have been doing is arguing against that
objective, and saying that it would be more fruitful to argue for "reform",
i. e., not to challenge a belief in God, but to challenge those
interpretations of religious doctrine which are counterproductive to the
goal of maximizing human well-being.  Now, from the above statement, I'm
getting the impression that there is a larger area of agreement between us
than I hitherto thought.

<<....for society, then enacting Laissez-Faire Capitalism will eventually
cause all institutional religion and other vestiges of destructive behaviour
to disappear.>>
    That sounds to me like something straight out of Ayn Rand.  And I
consider it wrong, wrong, wrong.  On several grounds.  Looking at it
parochially, in terms of the political and social alliances that prevail in
the USA, those persons who most advocate Laissez-Faire Capitalism are the
same people who advocate the dominance of religion over government, some of
them taking positions tantamount to advocating turning the USA into a
Christian theocracy.  As far as "vestiges of destructive behavior" is
concerned, this takes us back into considering the subject of altruism.  I
would say that history shows that where Laissez-Faire Capitalism prevails,
human greed comes to dominate and behavior becomes socially very
destructive, with all the wealth becoming concentrated into the hands of a
few, leaving the majority living in abject poverty.  The economic history of
the past 200 years in the economically advanced part of the world has been
one of developing legal and economic control systems which ameliorate the
worst effects of Laissez-Faire Capitalism and designing a system which
tempers the tendency toward greed and yet still allows sufficient rewards to
encourage economic enterprise.

    The above are the two salient points on which there might be continuing
controversy between us, although the first one could be one on which we can
declare peace.  Now I'll proceed to some discussion of less salient points.

<<Tell me: was your wife there with you? Does she share your interest to
railroad history?>>
    Not with me on this trip.  She has accompanied me when meetings have
included a higher proportion of trips on trains, sightseeing, etc.  She
takes a little bit of interest in the history, but not very intensively.

<<Also, you said you now mainly write software related to railroad history.
What kind of software?>>
    Lately, it's been mainly data-crunching, but my "first love" is more in
the GIS area.

<<I don't think Franklin and Marx referred to the same kind of religion
there. Marx obviously referred to traditional
Christianity/Islam/Judaism/etc. with all of its mystical elements and
imaginary stories. Franklin referred to a belief in free will and other
liberal ideas.>>
    I'd agree there's certainly a distinction.  And the Franklin brand of
religion perhaps should not, in fairness, be termed an "opiate".  I mean the
comparison in only a very general way.  I don't want to take the time to
expand on this right now, but this issue could transform itself into a
discussion of the various forms of deism.

<<As far as orthodox Jews are concerned, they give birth to many children,
which creates huge families, etc.>>
    Didn't realize that.  Here in a Christian-dominated culture, of course,
it is the Roman Catholics and the Mormons who raise large families.  In the
case of the RC's it's because they prohibit contraception.  In the case of
the Mormons, it's simply an attribute of the culture.  What is there in
Jewish orthodoxy that encourages large families?

<<.....according to Jewish religious laws, a wife cannot force the husband
to divorce her....>>
    That sounds strange to American ears.  Under US law, I believe common to
all the states, it is usually the wife who takes the initiative in divorce
actions.  While the law varies from state to state, I believe the general
tendency is to "symmetry", i. e., both partners in a marriage have equal
legal rights.  Although there are, I believe, some exceptions in some
states.  It is evident that in Israel, due no doubt to how the orthodox
heirarchy interprets the Bible, "women's rights" are far less advanced than
in the USA.  So this really should be a major element in any "reform"
movement.  To argue for equality of women in the divorce law structure.  Are
there any women's organizations working toward that end?  Women do have the
right to vote there, don't they?  It's obvious women take an active part in
politics, after all, you've had a woman head of state, something the US
hasn't.  One would think that women would want to get themselves organized
to change that situation.

<<.....there is still a small minority of husbands in Jail, with their wives
kept still married.....>>
    If you don't mind my saying so, from here we view Saudi Arabia as the
main bastion of craziness in the Middle East, but it sounds as if Israel has
a certain amount of craziness itself.

<<.....did you hear about the fact that the RIAA (Record Industry
Association of America) sued 216 file swappers....>>
    I haven't really been paying much attention to that issue.  Some sort of
compromise eventually needs to be worked out for this.  This is part of the
general problem of "intellectual property rights".  In the case of music, it
has long been possible for any person to record and distribute copies of
music, but using cassette recorders in this way never became common enough
to bring about any serious attempt at enforcement of anti-copying laws.  Now
Internet has "suddenly" made copying very simple, and the usual source of
revenue for the creators of music are starting to be seriously affected.  If
this is carried to an extreme, people will stop writing songs and recording
music.  This could lead to the death of the commercial recording industry.
So what's the solution?  You're a smart guy.  Think of something.

Best regards, ----------------------Adrian

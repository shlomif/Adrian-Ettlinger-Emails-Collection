i did get a bit since i owned excel shares, but not as much as i could have 
if i sold before the crash(es)

well now i'm not sure it is Debian.  i know Debian is our work environment, 
but now i'm not sure what is on the embedded processor.  actually, i dont 
think Starent did the port.  I think the chip manufacturer, Broadcom, did 
it.  Is there a way to tell what distro from just the linux directory?

i use the VIM editor, but many use xemacs with exceed.  we run windows but 
ssh into linux build machines.  bitkeeper archives the code.  there are 
about half a dozen packages.  it takes about 4 hours to build the entire 
tree, but typically you work with one package which takes about a half hour 
to build.  i'm not very close to the testing/shipping process, but i know 
we cut a branch for a customer and do all the bug fixes in the 
branch.  there is an "automatic" process which merges the fixes from the 
branch into the mainline.

>on your development workstations?
yes, there is a simulator that runs on x-86.  the embedded system is 
Mips.  it's quite a pain to keep the x-86 working and building.


>Is it necessary to test the code inside
>an embedded system often?
the simulator is good for CLI development.  but not much else, in my 
opinion. i'd rather see the company invest in more hardware than more 
engineering time to develop and maintain a simulator than becomes less and 
less useful over time.

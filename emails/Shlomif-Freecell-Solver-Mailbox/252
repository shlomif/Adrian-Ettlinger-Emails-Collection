Hi Shlomi,

    I'd like to select just a few salient points here, since elaborating on
every single point would drag this message out ad infinitum.

    One subject I'm "tabling" for the moment is Altruism.  This could be an
entire thread in itself, but is tangential at this time.  In addition to
which, you gave me a web reference that I'd prefer to defer until later.

    To dismiss some incidental points:
AE: My mother did not "keep kosher", but my parents would never eat pork,
although they would bacon and shellfish.
SF: You're not supposed to eat bacon because bacon is Pig's meat. Ditto for
shellfish which are not kosher.
    I'm very well aware of that, was just giving you an illustration of how
some (really "many") Amercan Jews compromise with the dietary rules.  I even
do myself, following the same rules as did my parents.  Hard to explain my
motivation.  Might just be a "superstition" that I shouldn't eat pork.

SF:: It's not just an image. Statistically, Jews in the U.S. (and other
places) are more well-off and better educated than gentiles. (did you know
that 20% of the Noble Prize laureates were Jewish while Jews are less than
1% of the world population?). But most of them are Secular or semi-secular
Jews, and not really orthodox ones.
    Yes, I know I'd heard a statistic something like that.

    Now then, here's the specific point of departure I'd like to use for
some continuing dialogue:
AE:    With regard to my friend who thinks (contrary to my opinion) that you
are just engaging in another form of religious activity in proselytizing for
atheism:
SF:    I think Atheists should try to convert other people to atheism as
well, because that way these people will be happier.

    I had told you about an atheist friend who reacted to my description of
you negatively as indicated.  Now I'd like to pursue that further, and tell
you why I feel there is genuine food for thought in that direction.

    First, I'd appreciate it if you could elaborate further on what you'd
said much earlier in this discussion, in that you "accused" Orthodoxy as
preached in Israel as having a pernicious effect on education.  Please give
me more details as to the mechanics of how this operates.  Are the teachings
of Orthodoxy what you would call "anti-scientific"?

    To get to the main point on which I'd like to debate, and attack it
frontally, here's the argument.  You have cited a number of examples to show
that the root of religious Judaism rests upon the God concept, from which
you conclude that it is necessary to destroy the God concept to bring
"enlightenment".  My counter-argument:  Just as there can be no objective
proof of the existence of a deity, likewise there can be no objective proof
of the non-existence of same.  There are many shades of belief systems by
which individuals explain for themselves what you describe as your own "The
way I see it now existence simply exists."   My own personal view is more
along deistic lines.  Nevertheless, there can be a very substantial area of
agreement between you and I as to "what is best for society".  To put this
on a more pragmatic level, you are trying to package a "product" which you'd
like to sell to as many people as possible. I would suggest that the product
would "sell" better if did not include Atheism as a prerequisite.  I keep
thinking of parallels here in the US to "fundamentalist" Christianity versus
"rationalized" Christianity.  There are few Christian clergymen in the US
who preach a rationalized form of the religion, and who have a small but
very enthusiastic following.   I believe you would have a better chance of
"sellling" more people if you would formulate a concept for a "rationalized
Judaism".   Under rationalized Judaism, the individual is free to have
his/her own personal opinion as regards the deity, and the concentration is
on (in addition to a reverence for the historical traditions of the people)
the ethical and moral teachings, which can be interpreted as having been
designed entirely for the pragmatic purpose of being the best rules to have
in place to sustain a prosperous and peaceful society.

    Much further elaboration could be generated in support of the above, but
I'll await your reaction to what I've said so far.

Best regards, ----------------------------------Adrian

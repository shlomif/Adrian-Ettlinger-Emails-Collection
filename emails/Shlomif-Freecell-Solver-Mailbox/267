Hi Shlomi,

    I just read something that had me thinking of you immediately, and I'd
like to pass it along to you.  I'll mail it to you, if you'll pass me your
address.  Unless you have easy access to this book.  Actually, you'd enjoy
the entire book.

    You know about Richard P. Feynman?  There's a book (now out in
paperback), a collection of separate short autobiographical writings by him,
entitled "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!"  One passage in particular I
know you'd enjoy.  If you can locate the book, let me know and I'll point
you to it, or, if it's easier, give me your mailing address and I'll drop a
copy of the most delightful and interesting passage to you.

Best regards,-----------------Adrian

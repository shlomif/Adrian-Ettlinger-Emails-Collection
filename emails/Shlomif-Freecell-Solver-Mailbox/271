Hi Shlomi,

    I'm attaching, in straight text format, just one replacement reply to
straighten out how I first met Wilson.

    I should add that Wilson said he had something from me dated 1999, but
from the content, that had to be something from quite some time after I
first met him.  Do you want me to dig through old laptops to try to give you
a date when I first contacted Wilson.  I think it might have been as long
ago as 1995 or 1996.

Best regards, -------------------Adrian

S.F.: Did you meet them in real life?=20
A.E.: I've met Mike in person (later) but never Wilson. Come to think of =
it,=20
Wilson lives here on Cape Cod, but some distance from where I'm at.=20
After "refreshing my recollection", I met Wilson first and through him =
met Mike.  Wilson was maintaining a website which I believe was the =
first site for Freecell enthusiasts, started by Dave Ring, who organized =
the first project to recruit volunteer solvers to manually solve all =
32,000 original M/S Freecell hands.  Wilson had taken over the =
maintenance of the site from Dave Ring.  Mike had been one of Dave's =
volunteer solvers, and Wilson had been acquainted with him as a result.
S.F.: OK.=20

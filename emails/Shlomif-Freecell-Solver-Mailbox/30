Hi Shlomi,

    Thanks for the rundown on Internet architecture.  I was using the term
"Telephone" meaning "Communications path", which was incorrect.  Guess I
think of any communications circuit as a being like a telephone line.

    When I retried that game 10350 with 3 freecells, I didn't get the same
result I thought I'd remembered but I think I know why.  And therein is a
suggestion for you.  It would be better if you would distinguish in your
report between board you cannot solve as between the two reasons (1) You
have not found a win, but have not used up the iteration limit, and (2) The
program stopped because it hit an iteration limit which had been set by the
operator.   That distinction perhaps is more important in my thinking than
it is in yours.  Because I believe the solver ought to be expected to find
any solution that exists.  If it hits an iteration limit, then it hasn't
been allowed to really try.

<<<<And a movie reviewer. :-)>>   What do you mean by that?>>
    I thought I saw a discussion of a movie called "Humanity" in which you
participated.

<<I'm studying Electrical Engineering.>>
    That's my degree. Purdue '44.  That, of course, was before there was
software.  My career made a gradual transition from hardware work to
software.   The software part started in 1959.  Initially entirely in
low-level languages.

    Despite losing most of the day to holiday activities, I reached a
milestone in the FcPro-FCS merger.  I got to the point where I am compiling
all your code, including the interface, into FcPro without any diagnostics.
(Not quite, I'll look up one "warning" I get in your code and tell you about
it later--I'm sure it's trivial).  Next task is to hook in the user
interface to announce the results from your solver, which will take a little
time to puzzle through.  But I ought to have it ready some time tomorrow.
Then we'll see if it works.  My biggest concern is passing you the position
with proper pointing.  Likewise, getting the right pointing to your solution
moves, although we can work on that later if I can at least get the go-no go
answer from you.

<<didn't you receive the message I sent you with the zip file with the same
contents?>>
    That message did come in, but later.  Not sure what to make of the time
stamps.  The one on yours must be Israel time.
My first message reporting my "problem" in being ignorant of GZ, was
time-stamped.6:37AM, and the "Problem solved" one 9:32AM.  Your first reply
seems to have been received at 9:03AM.  I had checked E-mail before I went
to work on web searching, but that was probably just before your message
came in, about a half hour before I sent my 9:32AM message.  Would have
saved me some time if I'd had the ZIP from you, but it seems I must have
just missed it.  Well, wait a minute.  I didn't see your 9:03AM message when
I logged on at 9:32 to send that message, so yours must have been delayed in
transit somehow.  Oh, well, that's all history now.

Best regards,  ------------Adrian

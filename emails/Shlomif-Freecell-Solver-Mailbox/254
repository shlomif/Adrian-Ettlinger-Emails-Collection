Hi Shlomi,

<<What's up?>>
    Lot's is "up".  Firstly, once again, you provide me with a "challenge"
on many fronts.  I can see three major areas on which I should be responding
to your message of yesterday.  As magicians say "First we do the simple
tricks".  So I'm going to divide thie response into three separate messages.
In increasing order of the demand they impose are (1) The interview, (2)
What's going on in my personal life, and (3) How I respond to the Shlomi
brand of atheism.

    There's lot's of news in (2), but here I'll just talk about the
Interview.

    Yes, I'm still willing.  It sounds to me as if you have in mind
conducting the entire thing by instant messaging.  My first reaction is that
this goes somewhat against my grain, although I don't exclude it for at
least part of the process.  Part of the reason for this is temperamental.  I
don't regard myself as very adept at "thinking on my feet".  I hold my own
fairly well in face-to-face communication, but my best, most accurate and
most insightful communication occurs when I have time to consider my
responses.  For this reason, E-mial is a form of communication which I
regard as ideal suited to my termperament.  I am concerned that if we
conduct an interview exclusively through the medium of one session of
instant communication, after it's all over and I see the result, I'll be
very disappointed in the result, and will be saying "I really botched it;
there are at least a dozen places where I could have given much better
answers".  Part of this would have to do with simple memory for facts -- a
need to "reflect my recollection" about specific facts from the past, and
part of it is simply the language used to express the answer.

    Don't get me wrong.  If you have a hard and fast ground rule that you
want this to be done entirely in one session of instant messaging, I'll go
along.  But I would much prefer a format where, let's say, we start out by
exchanging E-mails.  Shoot me a first round of questions and give me a
little time to compose some answers.  Perhaps the second round could then be
an instant messaging session, or maybe not, maybe a second round of
E-mailiing.  Certainly, one instant messaging session would be used as part
of the process.

    Your reaction might be that I'm big-dealing this thing beyond its
importance.  Anyway, let me know your reaction to what I've said.

Best regards, -------------------------Adrian

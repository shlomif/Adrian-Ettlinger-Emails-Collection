Hi Shlomi,

<<I still don't understand why the Solver Evaluation Edition is a distinct
development from the normal FC-Pro development chain. Why not keep them
inside and simply further develop FC-Pro starting from them.>>
    A couple of reasons.  One is Mike Keller.  He's been performing the role
of dealing with the user base and fielding all the inquiries, something I'd
like to stay away from.  I wouldn't want to do it without his concurrence,
and he seems to be in a nonresponxive mood.  The other reason is I consider
FCS not really ready yet to assume its proper role for FcPro purposes, i.
e., to provide reliable verdicts without false impossibles.

<<1. The auto-play plays way too fast.>>
    That's a function of computer speed, and you must be using a very fast
computer.  I suppose I could make it timer-dependant when running on a very
fast machine, but that'd be a little project.

<<2. During a range solving the display of the board flicker with abnormal
animations.>>
   Don't quite understand what effect you're seeing.  But that also might
relate to your using a superfast computer.

<< 3. There is no way to stop the range solving.>>
    Typing the ESC key should do it.

<< 4. Wishlist: Bob Gorman's Cognitive Features.>>
    I can't get excited about that.  I think he could use his imagination
and devise a procedure to use the "open file" feature now in FcPro to get a
Notepad display of the solution to which notes could be added.

Best regards, ------------Adrian

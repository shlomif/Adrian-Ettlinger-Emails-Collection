Hi Shlomi,

    I just now dispatched the other message, mainly about the interview, but
touching briefly on the Altruism discussion.   While some thoughts are fresh
in mind, thought I'd express them.

    You'd said this:
<<it's a pretty standard Objectivist attitude toward altruism>>
    Indicating to me that perhaps there's some literature I haven't read on
the subject.  Can't say I know very much about objectivism, but it's easy
enough to imagine what the word means.  The question could become "Is
Altruism inconsistent with Objectivism?"  Suppose we say a formal debate
were being staged on that question.  If you would take the affirmative, I'd
take the negative.

    There are a variety of other questions that could be framed to further
define, or to aid me in understanding your attitude toward Altrusim, viz:

"There would be more aggregate human happiness, and less aggregate human
misery, if no one engaged in altruistic behavior."

"There would be more aggregate human happiness, and less aggregate human
misery, if altruism were not advocated as a mode of human behavior."

"There would be more aggregate human happiness, and less aggregate human
misery, if the God concept were not employed to advocate altruism as a mode
of human behavior."

    Perhaps a question I might ask you is whether you would take the
affirmative in a debate on any of the above three, or only some of them.

Best regards, ----------------------Adrian

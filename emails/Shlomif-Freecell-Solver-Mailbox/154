Hi Shlomi,

<<During play moving cards to the foundations does not happen too often.
Usually, I arrange all my cards as decreasing-order stacks and then press
autoplay to watch them all being flourished.>>
    That's certainly one way to play and I can see once you get into that
habit you'd want to stick with it.  But most of the worldwide
Freecell-playing population isn't as smart as you and I'm sure find the game
easier to play if the "safe" foundation moves are made for them.
Freecell-playing ability must be a specialized talent.  Not long ago I ran
into a fellow I hadn't seen for a number of years, who I once dealt with,
and who I considered one of the most brilliant engineers with whom I'd ever
been acquainted.  He'd run across my name by web searching in connection
with Freecell, and he told me he'd been working on game #1941 for months and
wondered if it was solvable.

<<That would require putting this prune after any move that is conducted in
the tests function (while still maintaing the meta-move integrity).>>
    That's just what I'm intending to do.  I'm going to try to make it so
that no state containing a "safe" move (which I'm calling a mustmove) to the
foundation is ever placed on the stack.

<<in Israel we have very few railroads.>>
    Yet as I recall there is an Israeli Railways, and I thought I'd heard
there is a fairly high-volume passenger service, which I've guessed is
probably a commuter service into Tel Aviv.  Is that right?  If so, is that
the only rail passenger service in the country?

    I focus entirely on US railroad history, although non-US history
sometimes has some interest.  In your part of the world, I've been intrigued
by the Hejaz Railway, which has been abandoned ever since T. E. Lawrence
blew it up during WWI.  I'd heard that at least until a few years ago, one
wrecked train was still there is the desert.  Somewhere either in Jordan or
western Saudi Arabia.

<<I'm more willing to make my moves M/S compatible as long as the moves to
the foundations are explicit.>>
    I think that'll be OK, because FcPro does have the capability to filter
out explicit moves.  The problem is the moves which could shift aces to
other than their original locations.

<<But if it is going to be implemented, it has to be compatible with all the
variations of solitaire Freecell Solver supports.>>        Seems to me it
could be made conditional so it would only be invoked when playing under the
Freecell setup (i. e., 8 stacks, any card to an empty cell, plus the other
options that define Freecell.  So that way it wouldn't have any effect on
other solitaire games.

Best regards, -----------Adrian

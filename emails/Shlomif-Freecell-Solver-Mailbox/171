Hi Shlomi,

<<Let me know if you encounter any other problems.>>
    Now I have a new problem you don't really want to hear about.   The
program behaves very differently if I start it from the Windows shortcut as
opposed to starting it from the compiler.  In fact, from the shortcut it's
awful -- half the solutions won't replay.  But I have some lines of
investigation I haven't tried yet.

<<how was your (recent) trip?>>
    Very enjoyable, although with some frustrations dealing with my delving
into some organizational politics involving one of the groups I'm in.  But
lots of good talk and joking around about oddities in railroading.  And nice
mountain scenery for part of it.

Best regards,  -------------------Adrian

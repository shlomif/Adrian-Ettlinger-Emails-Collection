Hi Shlomi,

    On second thought, I think I'll leave the method of access to your moves
as I now have it.

    I know it would be a better design for FcPro if I did declare it as
char* and use memory allocation as you do (I assume I will have to use
allocation if I change it to char*, correct?), but at this point, I'm just a
little apprehensive of a minor can of worms in locating all the places in
FcPro I might have to change.  So I'm planning to eliminate the moves
pointer argument in both of our codes, and I'll add a test to make sure we
don't overflow my 2500 move capacity.  If we run into some cases where your
moves overflow, I'll just expand the capacity (for the time being)

    My academic curiosity about the reason for the problem is now satisfied,
and I do appreciate how this process is broadening my education.

    On my agenda for today first will be that known cleanup, then see if I
can at least temporarily fix the illegal move problem, then implement the
range solve and solve from list features.  Incidently, I believe I
misdescribed the solve from list feature to you earlier.  This is not a
feature to solve an arbitrary board that is input from a file -- that is
done by loading the board file through another feature.  The solve list
feature takes a list of nonconsecutive game numbers and solves them
automatically in sequence.  I believe I introduced that feature as a result
of my work with Bill Raymond a few years ago.  It was to provide an easy way
to check out a list of supposed "Impossibles" from one solver against
FcPro's solver.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    You might really be able to help me out technically.  I have a project
where I might have to start learing Perl.  At the moment it's on a back
burner, but I'll let you know if I pick it up, and might use some guidance
from you.  Will be especially interested in advice for beginners.

<<That put aside, you haven't told me yet what your children and
grand-children do. I'll be very interested to know that.>>
    If you're really interested.  My daughter lives the closest.  She's an
art teacher in elementary school, and she's married to a union carpenter.
She really married "beneath her station" intellectually.  My son-in-law may
have a lot of native intelligence, but is extremely uneducated and not
interested in learning anything outside of his narrow sphere of interests.
They have three kids, a boy 11, and girl 9 and another boy 5.  All their
kids are very bright.  The 5-year old just had an IQ test and came out in
the140's somewhere.  (That's "genius" level).

     My son obtained an engineering degree and then told me he decided he
wanted a law degree, so he has both.  But he hasn't followed a standard
lucrative career as a lawyer.  He lives in the Washington area and works for
a public interest organization.  I think you and he might have a lot in
common.  He is more interested in being a useful citizen than he is in
acquiring wealth.  Which I think might be a paraphrase of how you have
described yourself as regards your interest in open-source software.  My
daughter-in-law is a very interesting person.  She had worked, and still
works occasionally, as a tour guide in Washington, and is very knowledgable
on area and national history.  My son definitely did not marry "beneath his
station" intellectually.  They're very compatible that way.  They have two
kids, a boy 11 and girl 8.  They aren't as ostensively bright as my
daughter's kids, but still decidedly above average, I'd say,  Their son, I
think, has the makings of an engineer or scientist -- he's very imaginative.

    Now that I've given some description of my family, I'm curious about
yours.  What business is your father in?  Is the family very religious?  I
was going to comment about the one Seder I went to, that the family was a
very observant orthodox one, and I recall the Seder as accompanied with a
lot of what I was going to call "religious" "liturgy".  But thinking about
it further, it might not be accurate to say it was "religious".  It was
perhaps more in the nature of "historical remembrance" of the background of
Jewish history.  So tell me, in your family Seders, do you follow any sort
of prescribed pattern of ceremony, or is it just an informal family
gathering?

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

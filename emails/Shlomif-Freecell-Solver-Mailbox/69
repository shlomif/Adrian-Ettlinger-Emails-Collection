Hi Shlomi,

<<My solver does not lie. >>
    I could get into semantic quibbling and say I didn't say it did.  I said
"A solver that tells lies isn't a very good one."  However, I know it
carried that implication, and as a matter of fact, I was thinking of sending
a immediate follow-up message to apologize for my remark.  Yes, you do not
say "I assure that there is no possible solution to this board."  This got
me to thinking.  I'd say there are three distinct possible goals for a
Freecell Solver design:

(1) To find as many solutions as possible, regardless of size, to as many
boards as possible in the least time.

(2) To find as many solutions as short as possible, to as many boards as
possible in the least time.

(3) To deliver a completely trustworthy verdict as to the solvabililty of as
many boards as possible in the least time.

    Of those three, (1) and (3) can be evaluated in a definitive way.  Two
solvers can be compared on an absolute basis as to their effectiveness over
a given range of boards.  (2), however, would be ambiguous as to its
evaluation, since one could always trade speed for shortness of solution.

    Now, then, I would add that the "ideal" solver would be capable of
operating in any of the above three modes.

[re Patsolve]<<You can send me the integration code (preferabbly with the
rest of FC-Pro because I'm not sure what I have is too much up-to-date).
Then, I can try and diagnose the problem.>>
    Thanks again for your offer of assistance, but I don't think it will be
necessary.  I made good progress yesterday, although much slower than I
hoped for.  I am now passing the position to the Tom's function
successfully.  I don't as yet have the function linked to the solver itself,
and think I'm going to have to use a different technique than I did with
FCS.  I would like to ask you a question about how we have FCS integrated.
It looks to me as if the position is passed from the interface function to
the solver by a string, which string I suppose is the equivalent of the form
of the file normally read by the command line.  I think in a sense I "lucked
out" that the way I'm compiling FCS worked OK.  I compile your main code
separately as a console application, and just bodily transfer the object
files into FcPro's Win32 Application project workspace.  I have a hunch that
technique might not work if an attempt were made to use the board structure,
rather than a string, as the way to pass the position.  I have your function
code source being compiled as part of the FcPro application.  I did that
originally to make it easier to diagnose what was happening in it, but I'm
now thinking that this was essential to make it work.  That's what I've done
with the Patsolve function, and it's working OK, but I haven't tried to
connect it to the rest of the code as yet.  Tom is building his structure
directly in the function instead of transferring to a string, so I think
I'll have to compile all his code directly within the FcPro app. to make it
work.  This is going to take resolution of a few identical symbol names, so
will take some grinding work to accomplish.

Best regards,  ------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Well, I had to learn the hard way about Gzip.  From some Internet
searching, I finally discovered that winzip95.exe has the capability to
handle them.  I didn't previously have a copy of that.  My new laptop has
Windows XP, and it handles pkzipped files transparently, treating any .zip
file as a folder.  But it doesn't recognize gzip files.  And while there may
be some equivalent software to winzip95 in the new laptop, I haven't
discovered it as yet.

    So it seems I now finally have the source I'm going to need.  I have to
make a zip file out of it to transfer it to the other new laptop in which
I'm doing the new FcPro development.  I'm just about out of time before I
have to leave for our Thanksgiving dinner date with the family, so I"m not
very likely to have any results to report until some time tomorrow.

    What's wrong with good old-fashioned pkzip?  Is gzip really a whole lot
better?

Best regards, --------------Adrian

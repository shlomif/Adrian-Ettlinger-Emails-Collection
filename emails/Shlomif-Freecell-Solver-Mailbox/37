Hi Shlomi,

    Now have it running and playing back the solutions.  The pointers as I
had them set up were not working, and delivering garbage.  So I made
moves_string a global in your code, set up an external to it, and then was
able to capture the moves from you and copy them into my buffer.  There was
another glitch in that I hadn't looked up the sequence of the cards within
each move as they are stored in my buffer, and the order of the
source-destination is reversed, as well as the order of the moves.  As an
expedient, I just put in a swap at the exit of your render_move routine, and
that made it work.  A kludge on top of a kludge.

    It's still  of some academic interest to me what needs to be done to do
it legitamitely with pointers.  Later on I'll give you the full information
on the diagnostics.

    Also later on -- most assuredly by tomorrow (Saturday) morning your
time, I'll be able to send you a copy of FcPro with your solver at least
partially implemented, so you can play with it.  I suppose I can assume that
you do not observe the Sabbath by refrainng from turning on your computer.

Best regards, ---------Adrian

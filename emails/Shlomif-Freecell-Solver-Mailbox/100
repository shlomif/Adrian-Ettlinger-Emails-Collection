Hi Shlomi,

    Yes, we manuevered ourselves into an accidental impasse.  You had said
you'd wait for Build 8, but I wasn't intending to do a Build 8 until I had
your multiple instance incorporated and also the full playback capability.
I don't mind sending you a full set of what I now have.

<<and see how those "v" things are managed.>>
    I haven't written any code yet to actually handle the "v" code.  What I
have works from saved files in which the card count, when there is a
relevant one, is inserted in place of the space that usually separates the
moves.  It will be simple enough to extend that to work from the "v" as
well -- the hard part is done.  I really don't see why you need to see that
to write the code for the "v" feature, but as I said, if you want to see how
I'm handling the saved files, I could send that .

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

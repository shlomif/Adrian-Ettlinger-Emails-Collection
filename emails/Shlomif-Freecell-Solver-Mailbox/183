Hi Shlomi,

    I fixed up that last stuff I'd mentioned and was ready to announce the
release, but I thought I'd pursue something I'd dipped into yesterday,
running across what at first seemed a deep mystery -- but I finally wound up
isolating what looks to me like a definite flaw in FCS.  Here's the story:

    If you noticed what I mentioned in a forum note to Bill Raymond, I have
a system for looking for false impossibles in which I can make it plow
through a file containing human-generated solutions to a large number of
games, and try out the solver on each successive intermediate position.  The
solution file is taken from Mike Keller's website.

    When I started to run it the other day, I found that it wouldn't get
through any one game without crashing.  My first suspicion was that it was a
problem of my own, but it was ambiguous.  The crash would alway occur on the
same position in each hand.  At first the only way I could set up the
positions was by having FcPro set up the initial position, and then play
through to the intermediate position.  So I thought it possible that
something in FcPro's play-through process was causing, or contributing, to
the problem.  So I went to the trouble of expanding the capability of
FcPro's "Custom Game" feature to allow it to set up an intermediate
position.  I then found that FCS was crashing consistently on certain
specific positions.  The crash would occur only after a few repeated tries
of the solver on the position.  But I have one position where it crashes
consistently on the second use of the solver on that position.

    I went to work trying to isolate in fc_pro_iface on just what part of
the code it is crashing.  It turned out that the crash is occurring in the
freecell_solver_user_free(instance) call at the exit from the solve routine.
I tried commenting out that call, and sure enough, it will then run for a
long time, through many hands in the test file, although after using the
solver somewhat over 1200 times, it will run out of virtual memory.  But I
was able to break up the test file into sections, and I do have notes now on
a large number of false impossibles that I can use for testing once we get
to trying out atomic moves.

    I'm attaching two files which show two of the positions on which it
crashes.   The file cust3s.txt is the most definitive -- it consistently
crashed on the second try of the solver on this position.  The file
cust1s.txt also will crash, but only after several repeated tries of the
solver.  To interpret these positions, this is the new format I've devised
to save intermediate positions.   The top part is just a picture of the
board, and when there is a "++" at the end of a line, the bottom line
represents the freecells and foundation positions.

    My thinking now is that, if you can fix this, I'd rather wait until we
get that taken care of before I do the announcement of the release.  This
probably explains a few sporadic crashes I saw in some of my earlier
testing.

Best regards, -----------------Adrian

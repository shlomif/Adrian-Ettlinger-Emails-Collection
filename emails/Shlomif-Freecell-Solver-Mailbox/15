Hi Shlomi,

    I took a look at the website where A* is described.  It seems
well-written;  I can't say I absorbed it fully, but I think I get the
general drift.

    I'll be most interested in comparing what A* does in comparison to DFS.
My anticipation is as follows.  A* might well for many, if not most, boards
provide a faster solution, and a more efficient solution (fewer moves) than
would DFS.  But I'd bet that there still would be a certain small percentage
of hands where A* would use many, many more iterations.  This is based on my
experience in playing Freecell.  I have manually solved all 32,000 standard
M/S boards.  The really difficult boards to solve are the ones that require
a very counterintuitive approach, i. e., that require creating intermediate
positions that look like they are going in the wrong direction from the
goal.  Which would seem to be counter to the strategy of approach of A*.

    I'm copying Bill Raymond on this, because his reaction would be
interesting to hear.

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

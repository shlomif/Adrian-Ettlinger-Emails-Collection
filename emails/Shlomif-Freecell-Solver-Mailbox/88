Hi Shlomi,

    Last two messages crossed.  Replies to yours, just received.

<<And what is Freecell No. 9? Is it 'l'?>>
    Yes, but I did not for the present implement FCS for 9 freecells.  I
have it for manual play and for the FcPro solver, but Patsolve only goes to
8.  I regard 9 as a superfluous frill, and only did it because there was
room on the screen (for a 1024-pixel-wide-screen), and once over the hurdle
of making 8 work, 9 works easily also.  I'm presently convinced that "8 is
enough" to solve any possible board, so 9 is there just in case that
assumption is later proven to be incorrect.  If you want to provide 9 with
FCS, we can easily support it.

<<The interface routine you have now makes use of only one instance. >>
    OK, then, I suppose I can install V2.0 with that interface, and it
should perform more or less the same way the as the present version.  That
sounds like a reasonable first step.

<<Whatever, I'll look into my records and compose a list of useful presets.
Note that there is a small change I'd like to add to the preset management
and that it to specify a variable iterations' step to each instance. >>
    OK.  Once I get over that other hurdle I mentioned and get the recorded
solution straightened out, I'll try to get V2.0 integrated one way or
another, and then we can follow up with a new interface file and whatever
other improvements you'd like to make.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I got around to looking into the Patsolve program which you mentioned as
the best one you know about from the standpoint of false impossibles.  The
gz file was 38K in size, and expanded into a file 180K named patsolve-2.3.

    Do I have the whole thing?  What do I do with it now?

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

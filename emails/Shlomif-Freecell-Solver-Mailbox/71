Hi Tom,   (cc: Shlomi)

    You both wrote about the same time on this issue.  Actually, Tom, Shlomi
mentioned the question to me a while back, expressing concern that it might
be "illegal" for me to use Patsolve unless FcPro were also GPL.

<<By the way, what is the license for FCPro? >>
    License, shmicense, I never thought about it.  But I've been giving away
the source freely to anyone who had a plausible reason to want it.
Actually, aside from Shlomi, that's only one other person.

<<There has been some noise on the list recently that suggests that not all
of the source code for FCPro is available? >>
    The only noise I recall was from Bill Raymond, but I corrected him in
his impression.

<<But ideally, FCPro would be GPL too.  I don't see why it shouldn't be...>>
    Any red tape involved?  Or do I just copy the verbiage you use?  Does
this impose any obligations on me to explain to anyone who asks how it works
(questions I might have to do a lot of study to answer?).

    Shlomi said "the source code of FC-Pro (minus the Don Woods' solver)"
The Don Woods solver per se is not in there, but a highly modified form of
it.  The core of it does copy the guts of his code.  There are also some
blocks of his original code still in the file but ocmmented out.  That could
be deleted easily enough.  But anyway, Don authorizes distribution of his
code given the inclusion of some credit text.   So is there really a
problem?  Does anyone have Don's E-mail address if I have to ask him?

    Tom, I'm writing this before I try the patch you suggested for the phony
impossible problem.

    I'll package a full set of the source for you, Tom, later on today.
Might as well send a copy to Shlomi also.  It's in a state of flux right now
if for no other reason than I've started to work on solution move
translation for Patsolve.  But I can leave out the under-construction
version of pat.c.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

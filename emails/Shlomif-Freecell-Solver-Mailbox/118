Hi Shlomi,

    Only certain specific areas of the lecture related to matters I might
comment upon, and here are the notes I made:
=============================
 Your definition of "supermove" is not the same as that employed in FcPro.
Multiple-card moves which are supported by M/S Freecell are not considered
"supermoves" by FcPro.  This is not easy to define briefly, although the
formula for computing the number of movable cards is fairly simple.
M/S-compatible multple-card moves maybe should be called by another term I
notice you use elsewhere -- metamoves.

 In that area,  the following sentence "Sometimes, ..." would be more
rigorously correct if it said:  "Sometimes, it is useful to move cards to
the freecells or temporarily to an empty column, so the card......."

Much further down:
"* Freecell Pro, OTOH, ignores the number of cards and expects such moves
to comply with what the original Microsoft Freecell would do in that case."
 You could update this to reflect that FcPro now does in fact make use of
"number of cards moved" so that it does in fact now replay any solution from
FCS.
=============================
    That's really about all I had to say.

Best regards, -------------------Adrian

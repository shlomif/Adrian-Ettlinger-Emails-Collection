Hi Tom and Shlomi,

    I'll get back to you later more definitively about the licensing
question.  I'm still in some discussion with Mike Keller, and he's been
rather slow in responding.  Also, I'm still in the thick of working on FcPro
to extend it to handle 8 and 9 freecells.  My own inclination is to do
whatever it is you guys decide ought to be done, but I don't want to get
Mike Keller's nose out of joint.  He's done a great deal for the Freecell
community, so I want him to be comfortable with whatever is done.  Frankly,
I'm still in the process of  "selling" him on the benefits of working
cooperatively with the two of you in the furtherence of Freecell solving.  I
don't think he's disagreeing in principle, but he's not as appreciative as I
think he shold be of the potential.  He's been focussing on the slowness of
both your solvers at doing range solving.

Best regards,  ------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    We're momentarily again in a virtual instant messaging mode.

<<.....make use of multiple processors, or computer clusters......>>
    Right, and like I said, I wouldn't give that much priority for the user
base of FcPro.

<<But I'd like to do it just for the heck of it,......>>
    That's what I half-suspected.

<<What are you doing in California?>>
    Sort of a miscellany, and there's less to do than I thought I might have
when I committed to the plane ticket.  My partner in the genealogy product
is there, and we'll have a brief working session on his computer.  What I
happen to be looking forward to most will be meeting at an organization
which relates to another recently renewed interest, and one that relates to
the dumbed-down level of the mindset of so many of my "fellow American
citizens", from the influence of Christian fundamentalism.  There's enough
influence from these quarters that the teaching of Darwinian evolution in
the public schools is still being challenged, and by a crowd of people who
are close to believing the earth is flat.  There's an organization called
the National Center for Science Education, based in Oakland, which I've been
E-mail corresponding with, and whose key people I've wanted to meet.  This
brings me into contact with a number of "nonbelievers", the type of people
whose company I'm sure you'd also enjoy.

Best regards, --------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<< I play the moves on the board in order to display the solution in
fc-solve.>>
    That's a reply to a question I seem to have asked for a second time in
my just-sent message.  What do you mean by "the board".  You mean with
actual physical cards?  Or on M/S Freecell?  Whose "board"?

<<FCS can solve board No. #9. Try running "make-microsoft-freecell-board 9 |
fc-solve -to 0124567". Of course, this method uses only a subset of the
possible multi-moves. How many iterations are required to solve it with all
the multi-moves enabled I know.
With "--method a-star" it solves it in 5800, and with both options the
board is solved in 255 iterations short.>>
    That's a bit better, but I'd still be curious as to why it behaves the
way it does with no options selected.  "-to" is "test order", I assume.  How
did you know to try it with that particular option?  Do you know from
experience it can help to omit 3?  I really ought to provide a field for
trying that feature from FcPro, which will, of course, mean adding a
parameter to the interface function.

<<It is possible some auto-moves are done by Fc-Pro but not by FCS, please
look into it.>>
    That's the nature of the problem.  FcPro might make an auto-move that
would foul up the position, and a few moves afterwards an illegal move will
show up.  That's what was happening with #114713 as reported in my other
message.  But, on the other hand, there all also places where with FcPro's
supermove not enabled, it won't make a move your solution expects.  So we're
between a rock and a hard place.  I'm contemplating that, once I get the
problem better defined, I might just drop work on replay for a while, and
work on range solving and solving from a list, both of which will be very
valuable to compare the two solvers.

<<Board No. 597964 is suffering from the same symptom.>>
    From my testing, it seems roughly 30% of all boards will exhibit the
problem.

<<The problems occurs only when I give the solver a large range of boards
such as 1 to 1000 to solve.>>
    Could be there's a real bug there.  Can you give me a specific setup
where it occurs?  And is it repeatable?  You could try different selections
for "Solrange.txt File Format".

Best regards, -------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Stand by while I play with it some more.  But it occurs to me if you are
rejecting backslashes only if at the very end of the line, there might be
some incompatibility between Windows and Unix as to how line breaks are
handled.

<<... what do you mean by "choke": do you mean crashes or do you mean that
it does not parse correctly?>>
    Just does not parse correctly.  I haven't spent any time in further
diagnosis, but the way the FcPro implementation functions, if there's an
illegal format in a preset, the solver returns "Intractable" immediately,
and that's what's happening if backslashes are present.

    I think we'd have a more universally usable system if you could simply
reject the backslash character regardless of the context in which it
appears.

Best regards,  -------------Adrian

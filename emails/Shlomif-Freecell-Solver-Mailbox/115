Hi Shlomi,

<<It is a name like "The John Galt Line" or "Divide and Conquer" or "Mary's
Little Lamb">>
    Aha!!  OK, now I get it.  Yes, I can see the benefit in that.  I'd still
like to implement it first as a simple one-character selection before going
to what I'd call a "pick list" in which the different "modes" can be
assigned "names".

    I've implemented the "pick list" approach in other applications and have
some templates I can use, so that won't be terribly difficult to implement
later on.

    I'd like to ask you this.  Have you developed any presets that are
especially effective for finding solutions for games with less than four
freecells, in particular, two and one?

     Also, were you're example names meant to be whimsical?  The kind of
names I'd think would be useful would be "Best for 2FC".  "Shortest
solutions", "Fastest solutions for 4FC", etc.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

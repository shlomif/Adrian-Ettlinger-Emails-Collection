Hi Shlomi,

    It's OK now.  At least for that particular hurdle.  There are two ways
to include a library in an application in DevStudio, and I still had the old
one included in a way that was taking precedent over the new one.

    Now I've got another strange problem related to the playback fix and the
"number of card moved" parameter.  Still analyzing it.  This comes up only
under a certain one of your presets, not under the default preset.

Best regards,  -------------Adrian

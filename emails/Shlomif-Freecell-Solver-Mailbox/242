Hi Shlomi,

    I've sent you a donation.  To be frank about it, if I'd had to go find a
Western Union office somewhere, I wasn't going to, but with some web
browsing, it looked like I could do it on line with a credit card.  So why
not? I figured.  It proved to be quite a struggle.  More details below.

    And I wonder if you can do me a favor.  Do you still have the zipped
source file I'd sent you?  Come to think of it, I think a few weeks ago I
got a message from you asking if you could post it on a website, and I was
so wrapped up with other things I neglected to reply.  Sorry.  I don't see
any reason why not, actually.

    I'm in an embarrassing situation.  I've had a request for the source
from a fellow who I like the way he expresses himself, and I'd like to send
it to him.  I had only two other requests over time, and in both cases I
asked the inquirer some simple questions about himself, and got no reply.
So I say to heck with them.  But this fellow volunteered just the sort of
information I'd want to ask.  Now the big problem is I don't know where I
filed the last collection of source files I'd put together.  I'm fairly
sure I'd sent you a copy.  If you could return a copy to me, and I can see
what name I put on it, that might help me find it.

    Now, as to the donation.  I didn't understand that there was no place to
put in all that information about the post office you wanted it addressed
to.  They insisted that I call them up and  talk to a person to validate it.
The only question they asked was whether I know you.  I assumed that didn't
have to be face-to-face, so I said yes.  And their agent told me that when
you send a money transfer overseas, all you need to use is the name and the
city and the recipient can pick it up at any Western Union office.  But you
do need the control number, which is 9053788290.  I was going to keep you in
suspense about the amount, but you might need to know that to pick it up, so
it's $50.   About 411 ILS, whatever that stands for.  Sheckels?

    So how come you wanted it to Tel Aviv?  I thought Technion was in Haifa.

Best regards, --------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Re Christmas, there's at least one place in the world where Christmas is
a civil holiday -- Japan.  I was surprised to find, visiting there once in
December, that the Ginza shopping area was as highly decorated with
Christmas decoration as Fifth Avenue in New York.   But, come to think of
it, I didn't determine whether that meant that Dec. 25 was a work holiday.

<<students' Hanukah vacation>>
    Is there normally a vacation for the entire eight days of Chanukh?  As I
recall in the US, observant Jews generally only take the first day off from
work.  How much of it is treated as a national holiday for work purposes?

<<Which takes out about 413 characters.>>
    Oh, then so that entire thing is one preset, then  I was thinking each
line was a preset in itself.  What does it mean that "method" keeps getting
repeated, which on the surface seems like it's contridicting itself. Is it
that the various methods are tried consecutively?

<<A user may freely edit his or her presets.>>
    But did I understand correctly that the user would do this by editing a
preset file which is on the hard drive?

    There would be a way to accomplish the same function, albeit perhaps in
a less user-friendly fashion, if the presets were just arbitrarily numbered,
and then a number typed into the present "Mode" box would designate which
numbered preset to use.  What would you think of that for at least a stopgap
method?  If you agreed to that, I think I could probably take care of
programming it to pick up the preset from the file and buffer it for use by
FCS.   Of course, I'd need to know the format of the file.

    Re the symmetrical year, right, but it is axiomaitic that there can be
only one symmetrical year per century.  And, come to think of it, over the
turn of a millenium, you get two symmetrcal years eleven years apart.  Did
you notice 1991?

Best regards,  --------------------Adrian

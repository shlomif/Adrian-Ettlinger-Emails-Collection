Hi Shlomi,

    I've started trying to do the homework.  You assigned this to me by
saying:
<<Did you read the FCS --help listing and USAGE file?>>
    Since I haven't tried to compile fc-solve, but only made a library, I
don't know where to find the FCS --help listing.  But, is there anything
there I need to read if I read the USAGE file (which I have perused)?

    I'd like to make clear to you that I really don't want to devote any
more time to this than I really have to in order to implement it to the
point where others can use it to its fullest potential.  I. e., I'm not
really that interested myself in acquiring the skills and knowledge needed
to so use it.

    Am I correct in this understanding?  For the example string you gave me
with a number of lines beginning with "--method", this example constitutes
one "preset", and each "method" is used in sequence during the solving of
each position, i. e., the meaning of "multi-tasking" is that, in effect, the
code cycles through the use of each method in sequence, going to a certain
depth each round, in the expectation that one of the methods is going to
find a solution, and this approach will avoid getting bogged down on certain
deals that happen to be very difficult for any one given method.

    At this point I have not studied the interface routine to figure out
just how I would go about applying the one sample preset you had sent.
Also, I won't be able to actually try it until I get back home about a week
from now.  But, when you get a chance, you might put together a collection
of different presets and send them to me.  I have no idea how many different
presets you have composed that you'd think it worthwhile for me to provide
as an initial set.  If the number is over 36, please send me the best 36 of
them.

    Since it's now early afternoon your time, I'll send this to you
immediately instead of holding it, although I'm still in the middle of my
study process.  I might not get any further until tomorrow your time anyway.


Best regards,  --------------Adrian

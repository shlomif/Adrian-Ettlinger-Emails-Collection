Hi Shlomi,

    Just a quick reply, with another detail on Sharon's talk.  Before he
referred to "abolition of the Ministry of Religion", he was making some
remarks about the pride he takes in his Jewish ancestry.  I hadn't been
paying attention to everything he was saying, as I was focussing mainly on
other aspects, but I started listening when he brought up the question of
Jewishness, as the mere fact that he should allude to that question was, I
thought, an indication that there must be something going on at a national
political level about the mechanisms (or state policy) by which Israel is
held in the status of being a "Jewish state".

    I was struck, also, that the level of decorum in the Knesset is much
more similar to that which prevails in the British and Canadian parliaments,
as opposed to the US Congress.  In both those bodies, speeches are
frequently interrupted by cheering and/or catcalls.  In the US Congress,
there is a rather strict decorum that speakers are never interrupted except
by an appointed leader who calls time when someone talks longer than the
time allotted to him/her.  In Canada and the UK, while there are shouts of
approval or disapproval during speeches, in the Knesset it goes further than
that, and members will sometimes start shouting at a speaker during the
middle of a speech.  In the session I watched, two members were ejected from
the chamber for their unruly behavior.

    I noticed also that some members, a minority, were wearing yarmulkas.
I'd assume those must be representatives from the more Orthodox parties.

<<And I don't know whether that would mean enacting civil marriages and the
like. It may still be a step in the right direction.>>
    I didn't hear anything mentioned about specifics such as marital law.  I
didn't even know there was a Ministry of Religion in the governmental
structure, but most certainly it's elimination would, I'd think, be
essential as a first step toward freeing the society from the influence of
the Orthodox establishment.  That probably can't happen overnight, but one
would think it would begin to loosen the Orthodox hold.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

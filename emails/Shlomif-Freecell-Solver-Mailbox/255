Hi Shlomi,

    OK, I won't quarrel with you if you'd like to start things off with an
IRC session.  Just so the scheme will include allowing me to "revise and
extend my remarks" (an expressioin one hears in the US Congress during
debates).  Now then, can I ask you to make the choice of what IRC system
we'll use (BTW, I don't really know whst the letters IRC stand for.  Is the
"IR" part "Instant Response"?  If so, what's the "C"?).  And give me the URL
where I go to download it.  Once we get it set up, I could devote any
morning through Friday to a session.

    Cape Cod is northerly enough on the seaboard that vacation houses are
typically not air-conditioned.  Very luckily for us, a hot spell just ended
and the outlook is for pleasant weather most of the rest of our stay.
Tonight we even have to sleep with blankets.

    To make a small start in discussing altruism further, when I told my son
about this, he said you've probably been reading Ayn Rand.  But let me ask
you one thing, which gets into semantics.  All this time you give to
promoting Linux?  Without compensation.  Would you deny that that is
altruistic behavior on your part?
(I ask that for the purpose of learning just what is your definition of the
word).

    A little more on the subject.  I don't know if there is a word which is
an antonym for Altruism.  But two "ism's" which strike me as inconstistent
with Altruism would be "Hedonism" and "Sadism".  If you think Altruism is
"bad", does that mean you think Hedonism and Sadism are "good"?

Best regards, ----------------------Adrian

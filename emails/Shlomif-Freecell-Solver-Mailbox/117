Hi Shlomi,

<<Note that this behaviour cannot improve the probability of reporting a

    Noted.  I still consider speed a highly important attribute, so I'd call
it worth pursuing.

<<I'll probably have to add a function to the interface to retrieve the
length of a stack.>>
    Sounds like maybe it's a bigger deal than I'd expected.  It's not really
a big deal for me, so I'll go ahead with what you've given me, and see what
happens.  I'm just about now to sit down and start work on it.

<<2.4.1 is equivalent to 2.4.2 AFA Win32 is concerned....>>
    Oh, OK, maybe then I'll take another look at the Win32 binary package.
It might save me some time, after all.

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

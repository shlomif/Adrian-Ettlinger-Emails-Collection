Hi Shlomi,

    Your last message spawns more questions, as has happened before.

    Oh, so you are a "weekend commuter", then.  And obviously you have a
room where you live in Haifa during the week.  You mention sometimes using
the train to travel home.  If I'd never mentioned before, my main interest
these days is railroads, mainly US RR history.  I knew Israel had a
railroad, but didn't know its routes.  What is the service like from Haifa
to TA?  Is there commuter service in TA that people use to get to and from
work daily?

    2-3 hours to drive 100 km. sounds rather slow.  Is there always heavy
traffic slowing it up?  Is there no express highway, only a local road?

    You don't know anyone else who has a credit card who you could work
with?  Don't have any friendly supporters among the faculty at Technion?

<<...a problem with my parents is that they don't approve too much of my
obsession with Linux and open source...>>
    Why would that be?  Not on professional grounds, I'd assume.  I'd guess
they might think you are spreading yourself too thin.  In fact, to be frank
about it, I've wondered how you can get away with doing so much else besides
your studies.  Are you really getting away with it?  If I'm not being too
personal here.

<<Happy passover, I hope you had (or will have) a nice Seder.>>
    I have to confess I'm really a lapsed Jew.  I was only aware this is
passover time from a casual mention I happened to hear on TV.  Of course, I
knew this was Easter time -- you can't get away from that in this
environment -- and I do remember the two holidays are related and happen
about the same time.  Interesting -- my wife came home from the market with
a box of Matzohs, and that was before I'd become aware it was passover time,
and I wondered why she picked this time.  I just asked her and she said they
were prominently displayed at the supermarket.  As to Seders, I've only been
to one in my life -- my parents didn't follow the custom, and I grew up in a
highly Reformed community, where I don't think anyone did.  My first and
only Seder was maybe 20 years ago at the home of a neighbor family who were
highly observant.

 .  Hope we do get to meet some day.  Perhaps I will get to Israel some
time, but not this year.  I'm not moving around very well at present because
of a hip that needs replacement surgery, which I'll probably have done
sometime later this year.

Best regards, ------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    My last reply was accidently sent to the forum, a mistake I make now and
then.  This is really better discussed one-on-one.

    This is in reply to your message of 29 Aug. explaining the recycle
feature.  These are my questions and comments:

    Are you thinking mainly of speeding up the operate for range solving?

    Frankly, I must say I'm very skeptical that much a speedup would be
gained by this process.  I can't imagine that the time required to parse the
command line can be more than the few microseconds, and that any improvement
would even be noticeable.  Most of the time is used up in the search
operation, which takes up much more time.

    But, in any case, if I'm going to use this, I'll need more hints about
just what I should do in the code.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I won't send you another example right now, but what I discovered in
board #4 raises a serious question.  Here it appears that, in an identical
situation to the one I showed you for board #114713, namely two vacant
stacks and no vacant freecells, you are moving two cards of a sequence
instead of just one.  If the number of cards which you can move will vary,
that really presents an untenable situation as far as replaying your
solutions is concerned.  It means that each move would need to be expressed
by three characters instead of two.  Is that really the case?

    If so, I don't really think your solutions meet the accepted standards
for notation of published solutions.

    Until we get this resolved, I think I'll move on to implement range
solving.  Or I might look into my bug first.

Best regards,  -----------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<<I did not start to work on the improved FCS interface module yet.>>
    OK, "Whenever".

    In the meantime, I've made good headway toward resolving the replay
problem  I now have some code for playback that will accept a third
character, when present, to indicate the number of cards to be moved to an
empty stack.  I'm just filling the character in in what would usually be a
space in the standard format.  In the first 100 hands, there are 18 hands
that need this treatment.  Three or four of them have a couple of locations,
the rest only one.

    But I need to ask you about this.  There are two hands where I cannot
interpret what the proper move sequence should be.  #23 and #90.  Here's the
full solution for #23.  It normally plays only to the middle of the sixth
line.  But with the new code, with a "4" inserted after the 4th move in the
sixth line (21482), it plays further (in sixteen of the other examples, this
kind of change makes it play all the way through).  In this hand #23, it
only plays into the next line.  But in trying to find a similar fix to go
past there, I can't figure out what the first move on the 7th line, which
I've marked, is supposed to do, i. e., how many cards is it supposed to
move?

    Hand #90 is a somewhat different problem.  The solution looks like this:
Note the sequence of moves 72-73-74-c7.  It would appear the first move, 72,
is supposed to move 7 cards.  But I don't see how the two subsequent moves
are supposed to clear the stack to allow the c7 move.

    Would appreciate when you can get to it if you could look into these.

Hi Shlomi,

    I'd like to add a slight revision to the spec that I had stated for the
interface design -- for the delivery of the count of cards moved to empty
stacks.  It would be more efficient if we made the rule that this
information be supplied only if more than one card is being moved.  I. e.,
do not include any "v1" indicators, only those that are "v2" or higher.  OK?

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

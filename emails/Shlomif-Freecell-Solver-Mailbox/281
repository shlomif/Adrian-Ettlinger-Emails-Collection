Hi Shlomi,

    Since your message crossed with my addendum, I'll respond to both here.

<<Furthermore, several apparently atheist doctrines like Socialism,
Communism, Fascism or Nazism are not truly atheist but have an implicit>>
    I'd agree except perhaps with respect to Socialism, which I regard as
applicable only to the economic sphere (under its pure definition), and
being essentially areligious.

    Anyway, getting back to our original point of discussion, my basic
argument is that the promotion of "secular Judaism" will likely be more
successful if it is not accompanied by a flat assertion that "God does not
exist".  The absolute atheist position denies any sort of Creator who
started to universe, or indeed any sort of entity in the universe that can
exist outside of human sensory perception.  That's something that I'll
expand on at a later time.  Once again, however, we are into semantics, i.
e., what do we mean by "God" or "the God concept"?

<<LFC is defined as a system that deploys both full economical freedom and
full individual freedom.>>
    Here is where the problem arises in this discussion.  Once again,
semantics, and what is meant by "individual freedom".  One can be
technically free in a legal sense, but in the early days of unregulated
Capitalism, much of the population was unable to enjoy the fruits of this
freedom, because the grossly unequal destribution of income meant that most
of the population lived in virtual "economic slavery", being forced to work
long hours at unrewarding labor merely to survive.  Only when the negative
effects of LFC came to be ameliorated by a legal and tax system of
regulation, did a significant middle class emerge.

<<I don't consider greed as necessarily wrong...>>
    For a milder word, "acquisitiveness" is certainly an incentive to
economic activity.  My argument, reiterating the above, is that without
outside intervention, the rewards of economic activity become concentrated
in the hands of a very few, and the system has never shown an ability to
self-regulate so as to reduce the extremes of distribution of income.

    But all of this is going off on a tangent from the original question,
which was the relationship of LFC to religion, and your expressed notion
that "More LFC will lead to less religion."  The evidence in the USA is that
the opposite is true.   In actuality, it's probably hard to prove a
connection either way.

<<"and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the
earth,">>
    This has probably occurred to you, but what I'd argue on behalf of
secular Judaism is that whoever wrote that, even if you want to maintain it
was written by God, wrote it before modern medicine cut way down on infant
mortality and increased life expectancy, and if given a chance today to
rewrite it, would phrase it differently.  Probably the closest parallel to
secular Judasim in the Christian-dominated USA is a movement loosely known
as "rationalized Christianity", which makes a similar argument.

<<....less advanced as far as marital laws are concerned, because these are
governed by Jewish law (or if you're of a different religion, the laws of
your religion).>>
    I suppose the reason for this policy is readily apparent.  I can see
that it is really a difficult problem how to design a system that will keep
Israel "A Jewish State", and to put marital law under the jurisdiction of
religious authorities is a logical way to do it.  It is probably realized,
and I can't argue with it, that the major threat to keeping Israel Jewish
would be to permit mixed marriages, i. e. a "mongrelization" of the
population.  Perhaps the policy is overprotective.  But it is difficult to
predict what the trend would be if civil marriage were introduced and mixed
marriages permitted.  The threat might be less than the conservative element
thinks.  But I can understand how there would be reluctance to take the
risk.  Is there much agitation in Israel to introduce civil marriage?

    I'm curious about the status of women in Israel in areas other than mari
tal (and divorce) law.  Here in the USA, with more and more women entering
the workplace and some rising to executive and management positions, there
is a certain amount of dissatisfaction among women that they don't receive
"equal pay for equal work and responsibility".  Is there any such issue in
Israel?  I. e., are women in Israel generally accorded equal status
economically in the workplace?

    With regard to intellectual property rights in music, I have to defer to
your information.  If it is true that no economic disadvantage can be
demonstrated resulting from free electronic distribution of music, then it
is entirely possible that the music industry is shooting itself in the foot
by its opposition.  The question becomes, in the long run, how many people
would just as soon spend the money to buy a CD as opposed to copying and
burning their own?  It might very well turn out that, in the long run, the
threat to the economics of the business will be no more severe than cassette
recorders turned out to be.

    Moving on to the addendum.

<<By un-constitutionally I mean that they behave in a manner that is against
objective (i.e: derived from logic) law.>>
    I suppose that gets into a rather complicated discussion of just what it
means.  Are we talking about "the natural rights of man"?  I suppose we
could say that this is codified in the writings of some of the Enlightenment
philosophers (I see Locke mentioned frequently).  Of course, the US system
is characterized by the "Founding Fathers" effort in reducing all this to
writing in a formal constitution.

<<Israel does not have a written consitution, but has a couple of "base
laws" that are eventually aimed to form a consitution.>>
    The "scholar" on that TV interview is Robert Bork, an ultra-conservative
whose nomination a Democratic Senate was able to block after he was
nominated by, I think, the first George Bush.  His reference implied a
written constitution, but I'd hope he knows better.  Perhaps the "base laws"
are considered to be a sort of "pseudo-constitution".

<<<<"giving short shrift to the Orthodox."  <<What do you mean by that?>>
    I'm not sure what the word "shrift" by itself really means, but "giving
short shrift" is an expression meaning "showing disdain for", "ignoring",
"refusing to recognize", etc.  The question then becomes, do the "Base Laws"
in themselves provide next to nothing to support the claims to influence of
the Orthodox establishment?   It sounds more like the Orthodox elements, in
this case, are operating in what might be called a vacuum of authority..  As
regards the Israel Supreme Court, it would seem they would have nowhere near
the power of the US Supreme Court, since there is no written constitution
against which they can declare a law unconstitutional.  Do they sometimes
rule a law invalid because it conflicts with "Base Law"?

<<... in Israel "anti-Zionist" has a negative cronotation of someone who
believes Israel should not exist at all ....>>
    I wasn't thinking of anti-Zionists in today's environment that way, and
I can't say I really know how or if the term is used nowadays in the USA.
It might mean the same thing.  Way back before Israel was established, it
did apply to Jews who did feel that it would not be a good idea to establish
a Jewish State in the Middle East.  But I'm thinking way, way back before
the Holocaust.  As I recall, way back then, my father was an anti-Zionist,
and maybe I was too, although I didn't really have any strong opinions at
the time.

<<I support the state of Israel as well. However, I do believe it must
become a completely non-discriminatory country.>>
    I certainly support also "Now".  It's a very tough question as to
whether Israel would retain its Jewish identity in the long term if it
became completely non-discriminatory, and that of course is what concerns
the conservatives.  However, if your idea of secular Judaism could gain
enough support, that would certainly be a very positive factor to that end.

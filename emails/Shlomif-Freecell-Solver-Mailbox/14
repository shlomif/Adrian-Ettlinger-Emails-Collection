Hi Shlomi,

    This is a revised version of the message previously sent, which I'm not
sure whether you received.  It is revised to reflect the change I'm making
in the return value, as described in my other message sent with this one.
--------------------------------------------------------
    Well, on the second look, I see that it was right before my eyes and I
didn't see it.  I think I now see how I can implement your solver, given
that you code for me a function.  I would like to define the function as
follows:

int Free2Solver(Position &orig, int NoFcs, int limit, int mode, int option)

    Position is a structure, and I'm attaching a file which I just made up
showing our present structure for a board.  I'm asking if you can work with
this structure, or if you'd like me to translate it into a structure of
yours.  Our actual Position structure has a number of additional elements,
but I stripped it down to show the required elements to define a position.
Other specs:

[ Original content; revised content follows;
Return value:  Result, one of three values  0=Impossible, 1= Limit expired,
2= Solution found.]

Return value:  Result.   0 = limit expired;   <0 = Impossible, negated
number of iterations  >0 = Solution found, positive number of iterations.

Arguments:
    Postion:   points to structure, as above.
    NoFcs:   is the number of freecells, a digit from 0 to 7.
    limit:   is the maximum number of iterations for the solver to use
    mode:   is the choice from among your three (?) modes of operation, i.
e. A*, DFS1, or DFS2 (are those the only choices?  If there are more
variations, let me know)
   option:   We haven't discussed this, and it depends on what you can
readily provide.  With our solver, the user can request four different
options.
    1:  Result only  -- just answer the question as to whether there is or
is not a solution possible
    2.  Range of boards to solve:  I think we can forget that one.  If I'll
want to implement that, I'll take care of it, deal the hands, and call your
solver once at a time.
    3.  Full solution.  I think for the time being, I'd just like you to
create an ASCII file entitled "solution.txt".  We also have an internal
format that is simply a long character string, unformatted, which lists the
moves, but we can defer consideration of that until later.  For that matter,
if solution output is something that will take some time to work out, we can
defer that also.
    4.  Solve from list.  This is to solve from a position found in a text
file with the name "solvlist.txt"  That can also be deferred until later, if
that would save time.

    So, what I'm saying above, is that I'd like to get started as soon as
possible, and if the quickest thing for you to do would be just to give me a
function that will return "result only", that's fine, for starters.  I'd say
the major thing we need to agree upon at the outset is the format in which I
present the board to you.  I don't mind writing some translating code, if
that's preferable for you.

    Oh, yes, my dumb question No.27.  I'd forgotten, but we have the solver
implemented to run under a thread.  That's something Wilson had done, and
something I've never worked with directly myself.  I guess the purpose must
be so that the solver can go on working and the user can still go on doing
other functions.  That poses a question of whether we will have any way to
abort your solver while it is running.  But we can deal with that later.
But... Do you see any particular problem I might run into in running your
solver from within a thread?  I could readily insert it for direct operation
also, if desired.

    I see my old friend Bill Raymond, from Fresno, CA, is following the
mailing list and has chimed in, and as you've seen, I replied.  Bill has had
the idea for some time that he'd like to like to stage a competition in
Freecell solver design.  That thought really doesn't turn me on at all.
You've seen by now what I had to say to him, which will also give you some
further insight as to what I have in mind for FcPro.

Best regards,  --------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    It still doesn't work, but I figured out why.

    I wanted it to be able to process a file which is a verbatim copy of the
way you type out presets, which includes a reverse slash at the end of each
line.  It's the reverse slashes that are now causing the problem.  When I
delete them from the file, it works.  Could you do another round in which
you add bypassing of reverse slash?

    Another embellishment would be nice, if it isn't too difficult.  You
type presets with a header, and provide one or more comment lines, all
beginning with a '#' character.  It would be nice to be able to have such
lines as title lines in the text files to identify them.  Could you put a
feature into cmd_line_chop so that it bypasses any line beginning with '#' ?

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

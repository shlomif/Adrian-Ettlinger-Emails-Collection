Hi Shlomi,

        With regard to higher precision in timing:  I had not discovered the
GetTickCount() function.  It looks very straightforward and I'd have no
hesitancy about applying it.  The function I had found revolves around an
"object" called "CRefTime", which seems to have a variety of functions
related to it, and even has the capability of working to 100 nanosecond
precision.  In fact, there is a function called Millisec() for getting a
measurement to that precision.  But applying that system is what scared me.
Now as to getting it done:  More below.

<<<<But don't we need some code modifications to make this available in the
FcPro implementation?>>
Indeed we do, assuming we desire such a thing.>>
    What we "desire", as I'll elaborate below, I'd propose to be something
for you to decide, after any discussion with me you'd like to have.

<<I see the FC-Pro integration as a way to provide the Win32 user with a
nice GUI for Freecell Solver. Most people will find using FCS from within an
integrated application nicer.......>>
    OK, that's fine.  Now I can appreciate where you're coming from.

<<What do you mean by "stay in the loop?">>
    I mean that the "authority" for further changes in version 6.5 should be
at least partially devolved to you.  I. e, for the most basic example, when
it comes time to incorporate later versions of FCS into this version of
FcPro, you should go ahead and do it yourself, and we wouldn't require that
you go through me to get it done.  That, let's say, is the minimum scope of
what you would take care of.  But then we could easily, as I see it, expand
the scope to include all of the functions now in the free2.c module.  This,
in fact, includes the time function.  So you could change the time function
there yourself to use either GetTickCount or CRefTime, as you see fit.  Now
then, I'm not sure how much of this work falls into the category of Win32
programming, and how much is within the subset that is ANSI C.  I don't mean
to saddle you with a need to go through a learning curve in Win32 that you'd
prefer not to have to give your time to.  So let me know how you feel about
this.

    Let's talk about "Where do we go from here?".  Your main purpose is to
provide the "public" with an easier way to use your solver than the command
line method.  So at some point we want to post FcPro Version 6.5 on a
website, yours or Mike Keller's.  I haven't yet heard from Mike as to how he
feels about you putting it on your site, but since he hasn't objected, I'd
assume this will not be any problem for him.  So the main question now is at
what point you would be comfortable posting it yourself.  For my part, I'd
have no objections to your posting Build 4 as it now exists.  So I'll leave
that up to you.

    Now then, as to the question of whether I'd recommend to Mike that he
post version 6.5 on his website.  With reference to this question, I should
tell you about the testing I've done over the past couple of days.  The
result of this testing is that I just have to say that FCS, in its current
state, does not in my opinion add much in the way of useful functionality to
the purposes of FcPro, as I consider its needs on the basis of the users
I've heard from.  The main reason for this is its proneness to false
impossibles.  The main use of the solver by our users, from what I've been
hearing, is to use the hot key F7 while playing the game to find out if an
intermediate position which a player has reached is solvable or not.  I have
at present a library of five positions reached in play, for which FcPro
gives a false impossible.  We know it's false because in each of these five
cases, there is a key move that can be made from the position, after which
the solver will say the game is winnable.  Well, in four of our five
examples, FCS also says impossible.  But it's even worse.  FCS also says
it's impossible after the key move is made, to a position which the FcPro
solver says is winnable.  So it seems, from this test, that on a net basis
FCS is more prone to false impossibles than is FcPro.

    Another phase of my testing was to do quite a bit of range solving at
zero through four freecells.  I found no discrepancies in impossibles at
three or four freecells, but a number at 0 to 2, and in general FCS has more
false impossibles than did FcPro.  Although one interesting aspect to it is
that FCS did better with 2 freecells, and FcPro better with 0 or 1.  If you
want those results in detail, i. e., the specific game numbers of FCS's
false impossibles, I have the records and could pass that along, and also,
for that matter, give you a detailed report on the five intermediate
position examples.

    I should say also that Patsolve looks much better from the false
impossible standpoint, although it does not appear as yet to be perfect.
Patsolve, so far, can solve three of the five examples.  I'm not absolutely
certain that the test of the other two was valid, and I'm hoping fairly soon
to have Patsolve also incorporated into FcPro to do more testing more
conveniently.

    So, let me know what you think of all this.

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

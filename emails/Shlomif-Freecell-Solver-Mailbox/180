Hi Shlomi,

<<So fcspres.txt can contain only one preset? That's not good.>>
    I still don't really understand your definition of what the word
"preset" refers to.  Depending, the default fcspres.txt file contains either
one or eight presets.  No, rereading it, I guess that is only one preset on
an extended line so as to include eight different methods.  I modified the
chop module source so that the backslash extender characters and C/R's are
ignored in reading the file.  The way I'm going to release FcPro for now,
there will be a choice of either one preset, extended if desired, in the
fcspres.txt file, or the hard-coded presets that will be in the .exe file.
If we find we have a large enough user base of people who really want to
compose their own sets of multiple presets to chose from, I can alway make
it fancier at a later date.  My initial assumption is that there aren't any,
or many, more people out there like you who want to experiment at length
composing their own presets.  If I'm proved wrong, I'll be glad to oblige
them.

    Could we say that a preset which includes more than one method (or
"step") might be referred to as a "multi-thread" preset?

<<I suggest we keep all the presets in a file which will reside in the same
directory as Freecell Pro.>>
    I was thinking of doing that, but then decided it would take me much
less time to hard-code, for the time being.  Depending upon demand, we might
do that when I integrate 2.6.

<<Again, I don't know if they will be as fast, but they should be fast
enough, if I collect enough primitive scans.>>
    I wouldn't mind them being considerably slower if they get around the
problem of the occasional deal that takes forever.

<<INI files are a standard way of configuring a Windows program. I believe
you sometimes found the need to modify them, especially during the Windows
3.11 days.>>
    Oh, yes, I certainly did.

<<The Win32 API contains some functions for managing them (refer to the
GetPrivateProfile* functions and GetProfile* functions).>>
    I hate to have to learn new stuff like that unless there's really a good
reason to.  I tend to cling to my own idisosyncratic approach until I'm
forced to change.

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I got your solver running.  It took some work, and wound up building my
own batch program.  I think the problem with yours was that it required a
certain directory structure, and it was easier to put everything in the same
subdirectory and do my own batch.

    I decided to test it out with some examples from my notes that the FcPro
solver had once announced false impossibles or took a huge number of
iterations.  With four freecells, you came out wth excellent performance,
far outdoing FcPro.

    But immediateley when I went to work on three freecells, I ran across,
so far, two false impossibles with your program. #9787 and #10350.  Also,
#13705 seems to be "Intractable".  My system used up its 270MB dof isk
space.  Question:  Is the depth count proportional to disk space, as it is
in FcPro?  If so, do you know a rule of thumb for how much depth to allow
per 1MB of available disk space?

    Would you like me to let you know of any more false impossibles I
discover with Freecell Solver?  BTW, the false impossibles are definitely
working in both directions.  I confirmed two boards at zero freecells which
Mike Keller told me about that I call Impossible and you solve.

Best regards,  ------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Ah, so glad you've read it.  Hope you enjoyed it as much as I am.

    What I thought related to some of our recent discussion was the chapter
"Is Electricity Fire?" where he tells about staying with some
rabbis-in-training at a Jewish Theological Seminary (this is the last few
pages of the chapter), and describes what the rabbinical students had in
mind in wanting to learn something about science.  In this paperback edition
I have, it's pp. 284-287.

    As a brief continuation of our main thread.  The fellow who I've spent
the past few days with is my partner who handles the distribution of the
software product I developed for genealogists.  We've been at a genealogists
convention in Pittsburgh.  In my mind I'd been categorizing this fellow as
an atheist, so I thought I'd ask him when he received his enlightenment.  He
replied "Why do you think I'm an atheist?".  Then I realized that in fact
he'd never so categorized himself to me, he'd merely told me he wasn't a
churchgoer.  His background, I found, puts him into a category I hadn't
previously considered.  He falls into what I think is a very small group in
this country.  From a completely secular family.  Same for his wife.  To
them, religion is simply something that they don't need and has no place in
their lives, and isn't worth thinking about.  They have nothing against
believers, and just don't think about the matter at all.

Best regards, ----------------------Adrian

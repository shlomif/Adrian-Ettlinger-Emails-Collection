Hi Shlomi,

    Good to hear back from you, and especially to get a confirmation that my
instinct about A* vs. DFS was correct.  I sent via the mailing list a
message to Bill Raymond.  That was unintentional, I'd meant to send it to
him directly, but didn't notice that the return address was the list.  No
harm done, I guess.

    I didn't mean to appear to be bugging you to speed up your work on the
function you're going to do for me.  I've had so much experience with lost
E-mail lately that I'm always apprehensive about lost messages, and I
wouldn't want a break in the chain of our communication from such a cause.
And you've generally been responding very quickly to my messages, so when
there was no indication for a couple of days that you'd received "Ready to
roll", thought I'd better check.

    One more point.  The more I think about it, the more I think you might
as well ignore that "option" parameter I was planning on passing.  For
starters, I can take care of all those variations.  Maybe later on I'll want
to dip into your code and partially implement some of those choices.  The
main question on my mind for the moment is how you will deliver back to me
the move-by-move solutions.  But even that I'm quite willing to omit in the
initial implementation.

    I've heard back from Mike Keller, and learned from him that you are
primarily interested in providing only "pure" C code which can be run only
under DOS.  That's useful to know, if correct.  I see no problem, and that
might mean that you and I could make a good team, and I'll perform the role
of bringing your solver into the Windows world.

Best regards,  --------------------Adrian

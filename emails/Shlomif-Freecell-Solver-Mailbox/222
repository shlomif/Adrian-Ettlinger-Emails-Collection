Hi Shlomi,

<<My presets are best suited to four freecells. I'll try to construct good
ones for a lesser number of freecells.>>
    I'd think there'd be a good chance for more effective presets for 3 down
to zero freecells.

<<If the preset contains both atomic moves-based and non-atomic moves-based
lines, then it will only accept an impossible verdict from a line that
contains all the tests, both the atomic and the non atomic.>>
    Do you mean that's the way it's now designed?  Or will be designed in
the future.?

    Re cmd_line_chop:  I don't see any place where you've changed it to
bypass quotation marks.  Also, you threw out an important change I'd made,
to allow it to bypass carriage return and line feeds -- actually to bypass
any control character (i. e., any character with a binary value lower than
the space character).   So I'll continue to use my version of that module.
The C/R,L/F bypass is important so it can use saved files that are formatted
so they can be read and understood easily, with the lines separated out
neatly on the page.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

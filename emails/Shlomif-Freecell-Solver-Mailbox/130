Hi Shlomi,

    My best guess as to how to parse it into a single line would be to do a
sweep through the string and replace all characters having a numerical value
less than the space character (which I think is 32) plus all "\" characters
with spaces.  Would that suffice?

Best regards,  --------------------Adrian

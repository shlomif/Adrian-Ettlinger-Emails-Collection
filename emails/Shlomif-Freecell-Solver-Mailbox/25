Hi Shlomi,

    Of all the bad timing.  Here I am primed to get going, and it seems the
Technion website is down right now, and I can't get to your site to download
the source.  Hopefully, this will be temporary and in another few hours I'll
be able to get to it.  Perhaps as a precaution, to make sure I get it, you
ought to E-mail the source to me as an attachment.  Except -- how large is
it?  If it's over 200K in size, please break it up into separate messages
with less than that in each attachment.  I have a filter to reject all
messages which, including attachments, exceed 200K.

    It must the middle of the night in Israel right now (8AM New York time).
Maybe I'll be able to download before you see this.  I'll send another
messge if I've been able to get it.  Do you know what is the time difference
between Eastern US and Israel?  Where are you in Israel, anyway?  Tel Aviv?

    In the meantime, there's useful work I can do to get ready for your
source.

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

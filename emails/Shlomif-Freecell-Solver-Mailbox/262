Hi Shlomi,

    I don't see any server called "FreeNode".  There's "Freedom" but not
"FreeNode".  EFnet doesn't work, and most of the others don't seem to work.
I get "unable to resolve....".  But I found one "undernet", that may have
worked.  It returned a different message, and I may have been connected.
Got something back like "ident received".

    When I wake up early, there's a quiet time when I can experiment some
more around 6-7AM, before everyone has waked up.  I did not attempt to
connect to a channel when I might have been connected to a server (the
"undernet").   I'll tinker with it some more early in the morning.

    You might tell me a little more about what I should expect to see when I
have successfully connected to a server.

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Acking your last.

    Also, I spent more time looking at the code today, and am now at the
point where I don't think I can do much until I get back home.  One thing
I'm a bit puzzled by, however, is that I totally ignored the new parameters,
and I still got a program that would compile, and it works.  The one thing I
want to try to figure out is just where resides the information that causes
a default preset to become effective.

    I don't really understand this:
<<I'll guess I'll have to delay splitting the search across several system
threads (which actually sounds quite scarry) to later on.>>
    Do we or do we not, on V2.4.2, have a program which uses multi=tasking
to search for a fast rerdict.???

Best regards, --------------Adrian

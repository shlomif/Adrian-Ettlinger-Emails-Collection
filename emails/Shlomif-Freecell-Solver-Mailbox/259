Hi Shlomi,

    Checked back in about a half hour later and saw your reply.

<<I did not disconnect, I was distructed working on something else. Then I
saw you made some comments and left.>>
    OK.  I didn't know how long I should hang in waiting for you to come
back.  We probably should make a rule about sticking in a message "Hang on a
few minutes" when one starts to be distracted.  Or how long one should wait
when the other end goes silent.

    Come to think of it, does the system send a message when one party
disconnects?  I. e., in the absence of such a notification, should one
assume the other party is still connected?

<<If possible, I'd like to conduct the interview on Thursday.>>
    I see no problem with that.  Hard to predict what would be the best time
for me, but most likely a choice between c. 1400 your time or 1800 your
time.  Again, it's just a matter that picking the wrong time could leave me
in a highly distracting environment surrounded by lots of people talking.

Best regards, ------------------------Adrian

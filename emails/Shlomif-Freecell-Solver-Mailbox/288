Hi Shlomi,

    Oh, well, I might as well put down some of this now while some thoughts
are fresh in mind, and do the other work later.

    Your discussion of personal vs. economic freedom really cuts to the
heart of the problem.

    Both kinds of freedom are very subjective. -- there is no objective way
to measure the degree of freedom of either kind which is provided by any
given economic or political system.  The only measure is how the population
in general feels about it.  And the population consists of many individuals,
so it can only be expressed in terms of how many people feel how free.

    Perhaps the one freedom that is most quantifiable is freedom of speech.
Both Israel and the US provide this freedom to a high degree, but it is not
absolute in either place.  There are some things one cannot get away with
saying in both societies, but by and large, most of the population feels it
has a wide latitude of freedom in this respect.  Under totalitarian
political systems like Fascism and Communism, of course, the limits of
speech are constrained to a very narrow range.

    Other personal freedoms we take for granted might be freedom to travel,
freedom of choice as to where to live or what to wear, etc.  There will
always be a minority of the extremely libertarian-minded who will feel
constrained in any society.

    But economic freedom poses much greater difficulties if you try to
quantize it.  The ultimate freedom is to be able to select one's career in
life, and to be able to seek employment wherever one may wish.  Under any
system, many people will be disatisfied with the course of their careers,
and many will blame the system for constraining them economically.  Of
course, the concept of this kind of freedom has only arisen in the modern
age, after industrial economies emerged from the formerly agrarian, where
most people were forced to subsist as best they could at some agricultural
pursuit.

    Now then, building on the last paragraph, let's look at economic history
under Laissez Faire Capitalism.  If we look at what life was like in the
early stages of LFC, we find much cause for frustration in the lives of the
mass of the people.  The term "wage slavery" had a real meaning, for the era
when much of the population was forced to work in the factory system at
subsistence wages.  Economic freedom was very enjoyable for the few who had
the energy and ability to become merchants or manufacturers, but in the very
earliest stages, this path was available only for those who were born into
families which already had some economic status.  It was the reaction to
this system which spawned the birth of Communism.  I doubt that you've ever
read Marx's "Das Capital", but if you did you'd find that what was
motivating Marx was the plight of the laboring classes in England.  Most of
the book reads as investigative journalism, i. e., "exposing" the
hopelessness in the working class and total lack of upward mobility.  This
was, it can be observed, much worse in England than in the US, because in
England the class system inherited from feudalism was what separated the
employers from the employed.  The US, at the same time (mid 19th century)
provided much more economic opportunity for most of the population (not
counting the slaves, of course).

    Eventually, LFC evolved into a structure where a substantial middle
class could emerge.  We could talk about whether this occurred because of or
in spite of the various interventions by governments in the operation of the
system, but let's not plunge into that controversy right now.  Instead, for
now, I'd just like to look at the earlier history of LFC, and the earliest
problem that cropped up and resulted in government intervention.  I would
submit that this first problem was the tendency toward monopoly.  With no
restraint on business methods, or rules to govern what is fair and unfair in
competitive practices, there was a strong tendency in almost every industry
for the major producers to dominate every market, and to have the smaller
producers become squeezed out.

    Monopoly had its effect in another way from the development of rail
transportation.  A railroad through any region inherently held monopoly
power at all the intermediate stations along any route.  In the US, there
was an era of very serious conflict, in particular between farmers and other
agricultural interests agains the railroads.  For a long time in most
states, the railroads held the upper hand by use of their economic power
which they employed very freely in bribing state legislatures (and federal
as well) to fend off any kind of regulation.  Eventually public opinion
overcame this situation, to the result that eventually the railroad industry
came to be regulated so irrationally that it was almost destroyed.
.
    But let's leave it at that.  I don't know whether in your defense of
LFC, you really mean to advocate a system with no rules whatsoever.  I'm
suggesting here that the first set of rules that must be thought up would be
how to counteract the tendency toward monopoly.

    I had some further thoughts in other areas, but this has dragged out
long enough for this installment.

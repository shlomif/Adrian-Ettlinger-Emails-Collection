Hi Shlomi,

    Our last two messages crossed.  I see you did reply to Bill Raymond
about A*.  We'll see whether he decides to argue further about it.  In my
past discussions, we got into a lot of semantical miscommunication and it
got rather frustrating.

    I took a further look at what I downloaded.  It looks to me like I have
to figure out how to use the Freecell Board Generator, see what file name
that generates, and then run fc-solve.exe with that file name in the command
line.  Sorry, but that sounds like a lot of trouble to have to go through.
Is there any simpler and faster way?  I might take another look later, but
I'm inclined to think I'd rather spend my time integrating FCS into FcPro.

    With my fixed-length buffer for moves, we do have a test, and if the
solution is too long, it says "Solvable, but the solution is too long to
display."  I increased the size to the point where I don't have any examples
that I know of that are too long.  But there isn't really any good reason
why I couldn't make the length indefinite.  I'm not sure whether, with
current operating systems, I'd have to code a memory allocation to
accommodate that.

    Yes, we need another parameter to point to the solution array.  I'm
somewhat weak in my understanding of how to use pointers, so you might have
to tutor me as to the exact syntax I should use to get access to your array
(or string).  And to express it when I call your routine.

    I'm not looking for sympathy, but I'm 76 years old and have to admit I
don't think as fast (or as deep) as I used to.

Best regards,  -----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    There are a number of points I'd like to pursue with you, and don't know
if I'll be able to get to all of them in this message.

    I think of all the thought-provoking you did in that last long message,
the most intriguing was in the last paragraph.
<<"The Secular Judaism Manifesto"..... Judaism is much more than a
religion>>
    I probably have mentioned to you previously my interest in comparative
religion.  I'd like to give you some of my reaction to this, and also to
inquire as to whether or not you as aware as you should be of the context in
which you are operating.  Here are some expressions of my reaction to your
comments.  I'll put this in sharply critical terms, mainly just to make some
points.

1.  The definition of "Judaism" is a question of semantics.  I would
advocate the following as a more accurate way to say this.  Judaism is the
name of religion, the religion followed by Jews who are not atheists.
Rather than saying "Judaism is much more than a religion" it would be more
accurate to say "Being a Jew is more than believing in Judaism".

2.  Hence "Secular Judaism" is a contradiction in terms.  What you are
advocating is better termed "Jewish Humanism".

    Which leads to the question: How aware are you of secularism as it is
advocated and practiced elsewhere in the world?  Here in the US we have long
had a movement called Ethical Culture.  In fact, that movement has many
Jewish atheists as members.  Perhaps the most prominent organization here,
however, is the American Humanist Association.  It has, I think, about
50,000 members.  There are also two organizations which have the word
"Athiest" in their name.  Do you know whether any of these organizations are
active in Israel.  I do believe that the Humanists, in particular, operate
internationally.

    I'm running out of time already, and there's more I'd like to discuss.
But, to answer one question.  My son's activity.  I don't know what you mean
by an "NPO".  But his organization is the Economic Policy Institute
(http://www.epinet.org )

    Oh, yes, on the Western Union transfer.  I got an E-mail notification
that the money was picked up.  Wasn't expecting that.  They have a more
efficient system than I suspected.  Just so it's true, that you actually did
pick up the money :-)  Maybe you'd better confirm that.  Hate to think that
someone else might have intercepted my E-mail, gotten the control number,
and stolen the money.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

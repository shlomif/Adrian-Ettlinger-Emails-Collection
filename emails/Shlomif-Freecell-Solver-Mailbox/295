Hi Shlomi,

    Re the nature of military service:
<<Yes, but these soldiers are free to quit the army at any time.>>
    Not really.  In voluntary armies, the personnel enlist for specific
periods of time, and cannot quit because they happen to disagree with their
orders.  They can, of course, elect not to re-enlist when their term of
service ends.

<<In Israel, army service is mandatory.>>
    I'd agree that in a conscripted army, the question is more difficult.
About all that can be said is that Israel is a democracy with an elected
government, and there is evidently a consensus of opinion that there should
be a draft.  Given that premise, the policy with regard to how troops are
assigned becomes the province of the military commanders.  They could if
they wished make service protecting the settlements on a volunteer basis,
but they probably don't think they could get the job done that way.

    Interestingly enough, it so happened that today I had lunch with my
friend Stan the secular Jew who lives in the Washington area and was
visiting New York.  We get together on occasion as a group of three
including George, who is of Greek extraction, and who follows world affairs
closely.  With respect to the draft in Israel, Stan mentioned that the
exemption from service of students at Yeshiva is an issue felt very keenly
by secular Jews.  I suppose you know all about that.  As Stan puts it, most
Israelis serve in the army immediately after high school, then he said it's
typical to take some time to travel internationally before entering college.
You've been fortunate to have been able to avoid it.  No criticism, I no
doubt would have done the same thing in the same circumstances.  Oh, yes,
Stan  mentioned having read of criticism in Israel also of the high cost of
the military protection of the settlements.  He, in fact, is much in
sympathy with your position.

    I learned also from these fellows about something which sounded very
interesting, from the standpoint of the search for peace.  Are you aware of
the Geneva Accord?

<<But my argument is that any religion or irrational idea system can
eventually give way to such actions. And that if a person or a society wish
to flourish they need to reject such beliefs upfront.<<
    There's an issue of cause and effect here.  I. e., is religion the CAUSE
behind aggressive national policies, or is religion simply something used to
RATIONALIZE aggressive impulses that would exist anyway?   I just a little
while ago saw part of a historical TV program about Nazi Germany, which
described how the German SS in France destroyed not only Jewish
institutions, but also Christian, i. e. it was policy to destroy all
religion.  I must concede, however, that Naziism had a creed which in itself
was tantamount to a religion.  Likewise, of course, Communism.  You can, of
course, say that all these are just other forms of mysticism.  So, this
leads to a conclusion that there seems to a rule that aggression always
finds a mystical way to justify itself.  But the question then becomes -- 
what is the real problem?  Is the problem the mysticism?  or the aggression?
I'll submit that the real problem is the aggression, and mysticism is no
more than a tool used by the promulgators of agression to gain the mass
support of a population.

    There's more to say on other issues, but I'll leave this one here for
the time being.

Best regards, ---------------------------------------------Adrian

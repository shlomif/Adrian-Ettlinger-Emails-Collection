Hi Shlomi,

    Thought I'd get a feel for what percentage of boards produce an "illegal
move".  Out of 1-8, it happened on 3, #2, 4 and 8.  But then, it testing #9,
it liked to want to run forever.  I stopped it after about 25 minutes (this
is on the 400 Mhz laptop).  Really will need to introduce graceful way to
abort.  I had to use "End Task" a couple of times, and then it brough the
whole computer to its knees -- had to do a reboot.

    What was different about this intractable compared to the others I'd
reported is that this one did not trap out with a full hard drive -- it just
kept on running.  I have a default 2000000 limit on iterations, and it
didn't trap out on that either.  So I have no idea what was going on.  The
FcPro solver solves #9 instantly.  But, you don't need to feel bad about the
"competition".  The second example on your illegal move list, #129164, you
solve instantly, but FcPro runs to close to a million of its "iterations"
(called "hands").

    This is encouraging, that the two solvers are appearing to complement
each other.  Although I'm not so sure whether or not that might apply more
to 4-freecell.  When I did that testing at less than 4, it seemed to me that
the boards for which FcPro was running a long time, FCS was also.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

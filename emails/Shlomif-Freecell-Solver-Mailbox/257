Hi Shlomi,

    I think I'm set up now.  I had to add Freenode to the server list, which
I was able to figure out how to do.  Then it appeared that I was accessing
it OK.  Then i had to add #mandrake-il to the channel list, which I was able
to figure out how to do.  Then I had to change my nickname because Adrian
was already in use.  So my nickname is now AdrianE.  I must have gotten into
the channel because I got back a message telling me it had to do with
Israel, and I hadn't given it any clues as to that.  So I do believe I'll be
ready to try to contact you at 1800 your time (11AM my time -- guess it's a
7 hour difference).

    The way the family schedule is, 11AM may not be as comfortable a time as
I thought it was going to be, but let's try it then anyway.  I gather you
can stand by for an E-mail letting you know I've logged on.  If you get this
any time before 11AM, let me know by E-mail whether or not you can be
standing by earlier for any substantial period of time -- I might want to
pick an earlier time -- which could be any time even starting now (it's now
1340 Israel time).

    Talk to you later.

Best regards, -----------------Adrian

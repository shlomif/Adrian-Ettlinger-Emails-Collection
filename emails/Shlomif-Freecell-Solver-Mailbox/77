Hi Shlomi,

    Your apparent requirements are growing beyond the bounds to which I was
contemplating helping you out.  I don't really understand what you'd like
the user interface to look like, and it's beginning to sound to me as if
there should be a separate dialog box for highly detailed setup of FCS
testing.  If it would be of any use to you for me to add a couple of simple
edit boxes to the present "Solve2" dialog box, I can do that.  Or I could
add a push button that would call a separate box of your design.  But I
can't really get involved in a project of the dimensions you are implying.

    In a similar spirit, what Bob Gorman wants goes beyond the realm of what
I can give priority to for the time being.  I'm only interested in providing
a testbed for solver evaluation, as far as my own efforts are concerned.
Some day Mike Keller might take over the general maintenance of FcPro, at
which time such general features could be put on the table.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

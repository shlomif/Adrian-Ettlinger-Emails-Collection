Hi Shlomi!

    We're now up on a new plateau.  I'd say now I can replay all except
about 1 in 300 solution.  The remaining problems, I think, are all on my
side of the fence, and are supermove-related.  Your new interface eliminates
all the examples I had related to "safe" moves, and also, for some reason,
eliminated three of the eight examples I had which I thought were related to
supermove, but I still have five of those examples left.

    So for the time being, I consider the ball as being in my court.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

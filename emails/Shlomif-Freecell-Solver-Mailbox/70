Hi Shlomi,

    I'm going to hold off on Build 6, probably for another day.  I just
received a message from Tom Holroyd, who was out of touch for a few days,
which tells me that I used some obselete files in putting together Patsolve,
and while I have it basically working, it has some flaws and is less than
optimum, so I might as well give it a little more time and bring it up to
what it ought to be.

    I plan to post a reply to Bill Raymond's message, but won't be able to
get to it until tomorrow morning.

Best regards,  -----------------Adrian

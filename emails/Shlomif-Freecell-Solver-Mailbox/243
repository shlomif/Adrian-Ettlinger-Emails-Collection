Hi Shlomi,

    Well, I don't want to get maudlin about it, but I like your spirit.  And
your honesty in telling me all the details of your money situation.  I can
understand that even if your family is well off, the burden of having three
of the family in university at the same time is going to be substantial.  It
certainly is in the US.

    I had been visualizing you as living in Haifa.  I must admit I am highly
ignorant of the geography of Israel, as to the distances.  I know Haifa is
the largest city to the north on the coast, but I have no idea of the
distance from Tel Aviv to Haifa.  How do you divide your time between the
two and how often do you travel back and forth?  (I have no idea whether
it's practical to commute daily from Tel Aviv to Haifa)

    Oh, so the currency really is Sheckels.  I was half-kidding, because
among Jews in the US, "sheckels" is sometimes used as a slang expression for
money.  Western Union said the $50 should translate to 221.85 sheckels.
(I'd misremembered it as 411).
.
<<I don't have a credit card number, so I don't know how I'm going to donate
anything to the FSF or ICCCF Holland.>>
    Can't you make a deal with someone who has a card to handle it for you?
Like a parent, for instance?  If we'd thought this out more, I might have
done it for you, but now we've shot our wad with the direct donation (sorry,
I'm not that inclined to be that much more generous so soon).

    I had no thoughts that this was a "loan", so don't be concerned about
that.

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Firstly, I got as far as the 8-freecell implementation for FCS (not yet
V2.0) to the point where it is now displaying solutions that replay
correctly.  I used as a test the board that FCS is uniquely capable of
solving (This board has the name "Ghoulish"), and that solution,
fortunately, was within the 70% of those that will play all the way.  But
then I discovered a bug that's been there all along, in that the saved
solution in the file "FCSsolution.txt" is not being properly recorded, and
will not play.  I'd like to fix that up before I move on to V2.0.

    In the meantime, I decided to take an advance look at the V2.0 stuff, so
I downloaded the file you'd previously told me about.  Then, I tried to
follow your instructions, which were as below.  My comments below each line:

<<1. Run the VCVARS32.bat batch file.>>
    I didn't see this file anywhere, but assumed I didn't need this step, as
I could unzip the files using pkunzip.

<<2. Enter the freecell-solver-2.0.0 directory.>>
    I have this directory, loaded with a lot of files.

<<3. Copy "config.h.orig." to "config.h">>
    Done.  That much I know how to do.

<<4. Type "nmake /f Makefile.win32 freecell-solver-static.lib" (or do you
want to build a DLL?)>>
    I don't want to build a DLL.  This as as far as we could get, and so far
it doesn't work.  Bear in mind, I make very little use of DOS these days.  I
was at first skeptical of that "nmake", but discovered that when I'm in a
DOS prompt under Windows 98, I do have that program, and that command line
puts it into operation.  But there's a major incompatibility between the
nmake I have and your source.  The compilation produces hundreds of
diagnostics, most of them syntax errors.

    I'm now going to move to my other working area, where I don't have
Internet access, and try the same thing on the newer laptop which has
Windows XP, just to see if maybe there's a different version of nmake there
that will be compatible with your files.  But there's also a possibility
that we need some global conditional set to get a proper complation.  If I'm
able to break through and get it to work, I'll send another E-mail.  But if
this is the only message you see from me, you can assume that I still have
the problem.

    If worst comes to worst, I can probably figure out from the Makefile
what source modules I need, and compile it as a console application using
VC++ 5.0, as I did previously.  Actually, I see I used VC++ 4.0 back then,
but probably either will work.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

Just putting the COPYING file in the directory is enough (and distributing
the COPYING file along with the code, of course).  You can also mention
that the code is covered under the GPL in the README.  If you really want
to, you can assign the copyright to the FSF (that requires sending them a
piece of paper, see the COPYING file), but it isn't required.  Putting a
mention of the GPL in each source file is safer, but more work.

There are no obligations whatsoever.  The code needs to be available, but
once you send a copy to Shlomi, he can host it and then you won't even
have to worry about that.

Sounds like it's cool the way it is.

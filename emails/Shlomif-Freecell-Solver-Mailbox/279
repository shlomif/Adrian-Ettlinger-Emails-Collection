Hi Shlomi,

    Just returned home on Tuesday.  The trip was very enjoyable, in many
aspects.  All having to do with the railroad history interest.  It included
an all-day train ride by courtesy of one of the major US railroads, as a
guest (along with 150 others) on the luxury train they use to provide
hospitality to customers.  Many other good experiences and interactions with
other people as well.

    Back to Atheism, Objectivism, etc.  I might add Deism and Pragmatism.  I
have that biography of Benjamin Franklin to which I referred at hand now,
and I might pick a few passages to quote to use as springboards for further
discussion.

    In a footnote, there is the book's author's definition of Deism:
"...the Enlightenment-era philosophy that (1) rejects the notion that faith
depends on received or revealed religious doctrines, (2) does not emphasize
an intimate or passionate spiritual relationship with God [or Christ], (3)
believes in a rather personal creator who set in motion the universe and all
its laws; (4) holds that reason and the study of nature tells us all that we
can know about the Creator."  Now, speaking for myself, I will maintain that
it is but a small step from that to atheism, (or "Humanism").  One might
answer that with "There's no way of knowing whether that Creator exists or
ever existed.  So what it really boils down to is a version of (4), which
says "reason and the study of nature tells us all that we can know about
anything"

    Here's a quip I think you'll like, from Diderot "A deist is someone who
has not lived long enough to become an atheist."

    But to get the main point I'd like to make.  Quotes excerpted from the
author's text.  "Above all, Franklin's beliefs were driven by pragmatism.
......stressed that is was socially useful to believe in the version of
divine providence and free will that he proposed. 'This religion will be a
powerful regulator of our actions, give us peace and tranquility within our
own minds, and render us benevolent, useful and beneficial to others.'"
:
    Consider those words "socially useful".  Later on in the 19th Century,
Karl Marx coined the expression "Religion is the opiate of the masses."
Franklin may have reacted that this is a caricature of his philosophy, but
that is certainly the direction he is heading.

    Now then, I'd like to move to the question "What is best advocated to
ameliorate the negative effects of religion?"  What is most relevant to your
particular environment is "What is best advocated in Israel?".  I will
submit that God is not the best target.  From a purely objectivist
standpoint, I would argue that, for the masses of the population, it's
better to let them have some religion, as an "opiate".  And that the target
should be a narrower one; how religion is interpreted into a prescription
for how to live.  I'm not really knowledgable enough about the specific
issues in Israel to be able to suggest the specific targets.  I know I've
heard a lot about marriage laws.  Do the orthodox rules tangibly distort
family life in this regard?  To put it in general terms, perhaps what I'm
suggesting is that the rallying cry should be "Freedom!!! Tolerance!!!"

    It's probably just as well I leave it at that for this installment.
Look forward to your comments.

Best regards, ------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi and Adrian,

      Thanks for copying me on this correspondence.

      I assumed Adrian meant that it produced fewer intractables,

not necessarily that it was faster.   We should be able to compare

them pretty easily once FCPro has both solvers integrated.


>OK. But realize that I do not intend Freecell Solver to report all

>solveable states as such.


      I don't understand what this means.


Michael

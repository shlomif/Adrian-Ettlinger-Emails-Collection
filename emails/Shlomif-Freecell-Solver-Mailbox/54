Hi Shlomi,

<<If you find out that the move is a stack to stack one, you can find out
how many cards are moved by finding what is the top card of the destination
stack, and then figuring where the sequence start in the source stack.
    Yes, there's no problem in a move into an occupied stack. FcPro also
figures out how many cards to move in that situation.

<<There can be a problem when moving something to an empty stack, though.>>
    Right.

<<That way, you can play all the moves that I input you in a consistent
manner.>>
    I don't understand that statement.  You just said there's a problem when
moving into an empty stack.

    Let me ask you this.  Do you always make a choice between (1) moving a
single card and (2) moving the maximum number of cards that can be moved?

Best regards,  -----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I'm posting a message to the mailing list.  We'll see what action it
brings.

    Hope you don't mind my questioning you to add to my knowledge of Israel,
and Jewry in general.  I'd like to ask you this.  You said your parents were
from different "Jewries".   Was "Jewries" a term of your own coining, or is
it a term in general use in Israel?  Either way, from your use of the term,
how many different "Jewries" are there?  I know about the Ashkenazy and
Sephardic, and I've heard about Ethiopian Jews, but in your usage, do the
two major categories break down into other categories, or maybe
sub-categories?

    Am I correct in my impression that by and large the more orthodox are
concentrated more heavily among the Sephardic?

Best regards,  --------------------Adrian

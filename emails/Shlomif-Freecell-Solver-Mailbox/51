Hi Shlomi,

<<Freecell Solver comes with a program that can generate the board of MS
Freecell (or FC-Pro for that matter) based on its number. Using it you can
write a script that feeds those boards to patsolve one by one and summarizes
the results. I can do that for you, if I'll know exactly what you need.>>
    I really appreciate the offer, but Tom and I are now communicating hot
and heavy, and I think I'm going to be able to work out something with him.

<<I have DevStudio 6.0 on this computer.>>
    Not surprised.  As I said, I'm behind the times.

<<I tried it out and it's very nice. However, I would like to have a
real-time display of the number of iterations FCS has done. When is it going
to be implemented?>>
    Yes, I want that also.  It'd speed it up if you'd coach me as to how to
do it.

<<Beside that, I managed to get FC-Pro to crash a couple of times, but so
far I did not find a way to reproduce it.>>
    It crashed on me once too, but I thought it might have related to a
highly risky way in which I had aborted FCS.  Another task on my agenda is
to install a graceful abort process.  I'm hopeful that there is not a
general crashing problem, because I did run it for quite a while
continuously without seeing it crash, when I didn't mess around by brutally
aborting it.

<<I managed to compile Fcpro 6.4, but I am getting a "Debug Error" when I
try to run it. It reads something like that:

Debug Error:
Program: ... fcpro.exe
Module:
File: i386\chkesp.c
Line: 42>>
    Is "chkesp.c" one of your modules?  It isn't mine.  But, regardless,
yes, the next step is for you to compile exactly what I'm compiling.  I have
to pull that together from the downstairs laptop.  Might not be able to get
to it until late this afternoon, as I have to go into the city later on this
morning.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    The Keepalive message was entirely appropriate.

    I had intended to do a little more work on my side of the fence before I
posted the new FcPro with FCS 2.6.1 installed, but then got distracted onto
other things.

    In our last exchange, I'd said I thought it was my fault that I had
destroyed the effect of your "prelude" mode by not having the preset lines
get names assigned them.  However, I've restored the naming, and I still
cannot detect any speed difference between two presets with and without the
prelude present.  So I'm curious as to whether you have confirmed that, in
fact, the prelude mode is accomplishing what it is supposed to accomplish.
I wonder if I might still be doing something wrong.

<<BTW, are you interested in receiving intermediate versions of a book I'm
writing on Freecell Solver?>>
    Yes, I would.

Best regards, ------------Adrian

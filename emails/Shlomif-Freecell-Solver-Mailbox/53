Hi Michael,

    Shlomi Fish has been doing some experimenting with Range Solve in Build
61.  We're hoping soon to also have Range Solve with his solver so we can
start cross-checking for false impossibles.

    Shlomi reported to me that Build 61 was crashing on Range Solve, and
when I checked it out, by golly, he was right.  It turned out that Build 60
was OK.  The only difference between the two builds is that I changed the
Build number to 61 because I'd made a mistake and had duplicated the use of
the number 60 in a previous build.  Which at first seemed like a deep
mystery, but it isnt.  I'd built Build 61 in a different, newer laptop, and
under Windows 98, not 95.  Here's hoping that it's not a 98/95 problem, but
a difference between the way I have the compiler set up.  The same thing
must be happening in yet a still newer laptop in which I'm doing the work to
integrate Shlomi's solver, because the program built there has the same
problem.  Another clue is that the newer program is 142K in size, whereas
the older compilation, that works, is 169K.

    Anyway, I did another compilation, calling this one Build 62, in the
older laptop, and it's working OK.  Be a good idea to replace the Build 61
you have on your site with this one immediately, as Build 61 is really bad
news.

    I'm copying Shlomi on this so he will get a copy of Build 62
immediately.

    Now I have to try to figure out what's different in the newer laptop to
see if I can get an equivalent compilation there.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

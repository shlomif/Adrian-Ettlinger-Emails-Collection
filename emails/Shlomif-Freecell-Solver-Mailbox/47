Hi Shlomi,

    I'm so concentrated for the present on replaying the solution that I
consider some other questions we're discussing as "momentarily peripheral".
But I don't want to use the thread of this dialogue, so I'll deal with them
briefly.  I'm going to divide this reponse into two messages, and this is
the "momentarily peripheral" one.

<<Actually, I'm also omitting 8 and 9. Freecell Solver has ten Freecell
tests labeled from 0 to 9.>>
    3 was also missing.  Is there a 3? This will be important when I get to
polishing up the range solve routine for maximum speed.  I can see that we
will need to do the same thing I am doing in FcPro's Range Solving, i. e.,
provide a choice of modes which will cause it to abandon a setting that
takes too long, and try something else instead.  We can discuss this in more
detail when we get there.

<<It is reproducible. Whenever I try to solve boards 1 to 1000, I get a
crash.>>
        Yes, I see it.  There is a problem.  I haven't done any range
testing for some time, and some kind of bug has snuck in there. But normally
range testing should be done with settings in "Max. Time A" or "Max. Hands"
and with a mode selected.  I seem to recall W as the best mode, but have to
"refresh my recollection" of that.  I got a crash at game 418 with no mode
set, and at 461 with mode W set.  That's something else I'll have to look
into.

<<If you are running it on UNIX, there's a way to instruct it to print its
current number of iterations to the screen at a certain point in its
runtime. I used it to make sure it is still progressing. I can show you how
to build a similar functionality into FC-Pro using the FCS functions.>>
    I'll want that later, but not now.  Re board #9, you say you ran it
under "soft-DFS".  I don't seem to be getting soft-DFS. Should an argument
of 2 get into that mode?  Have you provided that in the interface?  I don't
see a code for it.  What happens when you run it under straight DFS?  I
should have reached my 2000000 limit.  What kind of machine did you run #9
on, and how long did it take?

Best regards, ------------Adrian

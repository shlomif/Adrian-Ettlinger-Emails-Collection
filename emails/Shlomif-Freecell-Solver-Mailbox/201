Hi Shlomi,

    There's good news and bad news.

    The surprising good news:  It appears that 2.6.0 does not make false
impossibles whether one uses an atomic move preset or not.  Several
positions from various solutions which are false impossibles in 2.4.3 are
winnable in 2.6.0.  And this is with the same preset that I have hard-coded
in as the "best" for 2.4.3.

    The bad news.  I couldn't conduct a full comprehensive test with my
complete solution file because the program crashes after it's done a few
thousand positions.  This is not definable like the last crash.  It happens
in different circumstances, and on different positions in rerunning the same
test.  It seems to be more prone to happen when it hits a high iteration
count.  There are two ways I drive it for continuous solving.  One is the
special test where it plows through a list of solutions testing every
intermediate position.  (That's the test whose main purpose is to look for
false impossibles).  The other is for range solving.  It will also crash
during range solving, although it takes a longer run.  Interestingly, the
two deals on which I saw it crash were both impossibles.  I started a run
from 1 to 32000, and it crashed while doing 11982.  But then I did a run
from 10000 to 32000, and on that run, it went right through 11982 without
crashing, and ran all the way to 32000.  Then I tried a run from 130000 to
150000, remembering there's an impossible in that range, #146692.  Sure
enough, it crashed while working on tjat deal.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

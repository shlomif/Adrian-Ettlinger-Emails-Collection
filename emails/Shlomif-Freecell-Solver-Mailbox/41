Hi Shlomi,

   I'm now running version 6.5 in the W98 laptop.

    I haven't examined in detail all of the examples, but in the first one,
144713, where you pointed out the move that is being attempted, that one is
definitely a situation where the move could not be made in standard M/S
Freecell, but it can in FcPro with Supermove enable.  A four-card column to
column move cannot be made in standard freecell with two vacant columns
present (and no vacant freecell), but only if there is a vacant column plus
a vacant freecell -- or two vacant freecells.  I think it's probably safe to
assume that all of the other examples are similar.

    I'll look into, as a temporary expedient, enabling Supermove when
playing back your solutions in your solver, but I'm not so sure I'd want
that to remain the permanent solution.

    I might explain that I usually keep the W98 laptop upstairs in the
bedroom, where I have easy access to a telephone line, and this is the one I
use for E-mail.  The other, new (a couple of weeks) XP machine is
downstairs, and I haven't gone downstairs as yet.  So up to now I've been
limited to the experimentation I can do on this W98 laptop.  I just happened
to have a copy of version 6.5 here because I brought up a copy to E-mail to
you.  We ought to have at least a temporary solution to the illegal move
problem before we think of making 6.5 available to others for beta-testing.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

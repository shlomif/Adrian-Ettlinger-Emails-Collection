Hi Shlomi,

<<under Capitalism. LFC by itself was never exercised.>>
    I think we have to look at the "degree" of LFC that exists in any
economy at any given time.  In western Europe, feudalism was replaced by
capitalism in stages, and in the earliest stages was more LF than in the
later stages.  In the US, what can one point to in the early 19th century to
show that it wasn't LF?  I'd say that it was then about as LF as possible.

re what I think is called "Predatory pricing", i. e. selling at artificially
low prices to drive a much less well-financed company out of business.
<<1. I don't know how can this be resolved without violating common
economical freedoms (and even individual freedoms). Can you suggest a
provision against such situation that cannot be abused by the lawmaker?>>
    Interesting, in that in the US one hears so little of this kind of abuse
these days that I don't really know what the law is.  Large chain stores do
in fact continually drive out small, independently-owned ones because they,
by economies of scale, can sell at lower prices.  But this is not considered
"unfair" if the large chain is consistent in its pricing at all its outlets.
I do think it is illegal for a large chain to set prices at a given outlet
lower than its normal level at a new store for the purpose of driving out of
business a nearby competitor.

<<2. It is possible that you can argue that the local store "deserved" it.
They should have tried to expand, and become bigger after which they would
not have had this problem.>>
    Now you're restricting economic freedom.  Some people would like to earn
a living by operating providing good service operating one store, and one
store only.  They don't want the hassle of having to operate many stores.
It is not easy to define what is "unfair" competition, but "predatory
pricing" is generally recognized as "unfair", and as I said, is, I think,
illegal.

<<3. A possible richer player can open his own chain of stores to compete
with the abusive ones.>>
    When most business is in the hands of large national organizations,
management seems to become impersonal and service to the public
deteriorates.  A dominant retailer here is Walmart (I know they are
international -- are they in Israel?).  They have recently been in the news
about unfair hiring practices.

re my example of threats to banks preventing a new automobile company from
entering the competitive market.
<<Hmmm.. did not think such a situation was actually possible. Again, in an
LFC society my instinct would tell me that some banks won't surrender to
the big players, or even all of them would tell them that they won't accept
their conditions.>>
    It happens very frequently that large, powerful organizations will use
their economic power to threaten customers who want to transfer their
business to smaller companies.  Just a few weeks ago I heard about such a
case in the railroad industry.

<<<<The above examples indicate some areas in which rules are necessary.>>
I'm not sure they do.>>
    My main point here is that this is a very complicated issue, for which
there is no clearcut answer.  To put it bluntly, when you grant unrestricted
"freedom" to the rich and powerful, experience shows that the "freedom" of
the nonrich and powerless becomes restricted.   One US politcian in a speech
several years ago put it well.  He said something like "I want to leave the
ladders in place so anyone can climb them.  Others want to climb the ladder
and then pull it up behind them."

    I'm not taking the time right now to look at those links you gave me,
but will try to give them some study later one.

<<Neo-Tech claims such a thing can be done by private polices and militias
as well as private courts, etc. Don't know. Such a system was not fully
tried.>>
    I'd call that a hopelessly idealistic concept.  Someone has to pay the
salaries and operating expenses, regardless of who does it.  Sounds like a
move toward a tribal society, and the private polices and militias would
wind up fighting each other.

<<The wealth freed up would go directly to the private sector, creating jobs
for the poor, decreasing the demand on private charity, and increasing
charitable giving.>>
    That's what's called the "trickle-down" theory.  It's pretty well
established that that simply doesn't work.

    Re Israel's specific problems, I'm not sure we should get very deeply
into that.  You mention the settlements, and the cost of maintaining them,
and, yes, that is certainly a very difficult complicating factor.  I'd
summarize the problem on the Palestinian side that there is a substantial
element of fanatics who refuse to recognize Israel's right to exist, and the
majority who would just like to live in peace do not the motivation or
ability to take control of their own situation.  But, on the other hand, you
do also have an element in Israel who are the hard-line Zionists who want to
expand the country to include the entire area.  It was under that impulse
that the settlements were established, and that has created a situation for
which it's very difficult to find a solution.

    Enough for now.  I have some thoughts on "objectivism" which I really
need to get to later.

Best regards, ---------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

(I wrote the below last night before retiring, but a problem with my mail
server didn't allow me to send it.  I have some more thoughts now fresh in
mind, but I'll put those into a separate message a little later).

    Just continuing a couple of threads we had.

<<"The human mind is an organism that does not age if kept disease free -- 
if kept free of mysticism.">>
    I cited as a counter atheists with Alzheimer's, to which you objected.
If that's a bad example, then we have to figure out what the author of that
statement meant by "aging" of the mind.  I simply do not accept that whether
a mind believes in mysticism has anything to do with how it ages in any
respect.

<<"old-people views" or cynicism>>
    Cynicism could be one example of an attitude which often becomes
enhanced with age.  But this, I think, is a bad example for the premise.  I
think people who believe in mysticism are less likely to develop cynical
views in old age.

<<You are right that some of these ideas are contradictory, but as a whole
the bible as an idea system is harmful.>>
    Again, I don't know what the "idea system" of the bible is.  You might
extract part of it, e. g., the ten commandments, and say that is an idea
system.  However, regardless, harking back to the Neo-Tech argument, this
argument does refer to ethics -- it implies that somewhere within Neo-Tech
advocacy there is some sort of code of ethics.  I submit that part of this
code of ethics will bear great similarity to the code of ethics derived from
the Bible.  It is true, also, that the Bible will have some rules of
behavior that would not be contained in any code which anyone would design
today (dietary rules, as on example -- prohibitions against birth control as
another).  These aren't necessarily "bad" rules, they are just "obselete"
because they were written thousands of years ago.  Clinging to such rules
is, I'd acknowledge, one of the negative aspects of religion.  But there
still remains that part of a code of conduct which would be in common
betweeen the Bible and any code designed by a modern-day objectivist.

<<It isn't draconic. If the Jewish settlers wish to leave the settlements
and reside in Israel, they are welcome to do so.>>
    I consider it draconic because of what I'd anticipate would be the
likely consequences.  Namely that at least some settlements would not want
to move, would attempt to defend themselves, and would not be successful and
would be wiped out.  Regardless, I'd think this would be a very divisive
issue among Israelis. Can you tell me whether any active politician or
member of the Knesset has publicly advocated your policy?

    Getting late.  No more for now.

Best regards, -------------------------Adrian

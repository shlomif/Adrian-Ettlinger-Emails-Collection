Hi Shlomi,

    Here is what should be a very useful clue to the free function crashing
problem.

    I'd found seven examples.  In five of these, the solution takes 50
iterations, and in the other two, 49.

    I did a range-solve run of 20,000 deals, with no mishaps.  In this run,
the lowest number of iterations for any solution was 58.

    To investigate further, I'm thinking I might put in a trap for any
solution under 51 iterations, to see if it's consistent that either
low-iteration-count or specific 49 or 50 iterations is causing the problem.

    Interesting, this explains another general feature of the problem which
had puzzled me.  No test of every position in a solution would play all the
way through without failing, and on my seven examples, all were failing
within 10-20 moves of the last move in the solution.  That I now see stands
to reason, since only after it gets close to the end will it be solving in a
low number of iterations.  In one case, this does not occur until the next
to the last move.

    It now certainly appears definite that there is a problem in the "free"
routine which manifests itself when there has been a solution with small
number (below 51) of iterations.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

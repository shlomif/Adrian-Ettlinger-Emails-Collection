Hi Shlomi,

    Sorry, it isn't really all that great.  I can't yet cite any specific
examples for you, but it does look like we are still getting some bad moves
out of FCS.

    I spent most of the time I worked on it trying to make sense about this
different results I'm getting dependng on how I start the program.  The same
preset between the two different starting methods can give different
solutions for the same deal.

    One question:  Did you or did you not implement a "safe" move inhibit in
your latest version?  I'm wondering if it was just an illusion that I
thought you had.

    I should be able to give you more of a definition of the problem
tomorrow.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<<I suggest you release it now as it is. There's no reason to wait for 2.6.x
to come along, and people may be anxious to try the new version.>>
    Very glad you concur.  I just about finished all the additional work
today, and surely will have it ready for release sometime tomorrow.  (Unless
some totally unexpected new problem show up).  I decided to make access to
the presets I now have as a "library" from you more readily accessible by
imbedding them in the code, but leaving the option of calling an external
file as I've been using up to now as the "standard".  Also just about have
the web page written from which the downloading will be done.  Mainly need
to write up an explanation of how to use some of the FCS options.

    But now, in preparation for atomic moves, could you please give me a
little more explanation of how they are going to work?  Your message said
"specify  ....-to 01ABCDE  ........or something similar....."  What I'm now
curious about is how flexible this will be.   I. e., and e. g., will an
atomic move preset be possible that will quickly solve that infamous game
#9?

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

    I'm writing this before checking the mailbox to see if you may have
already replied to my earlier message this morning (my time).  It's prompted
by something I just heard on television, which reminded me you'd said.
<<I disapprove of people acting un-constitutionaly due to religious
belief...>>
    I had thought that I might ask you "Whose constitution?".  I don't
really know much about the Israel Constitution.  I know it is supposed to
guarantee some form of freedom of religion.  But not much about how it does
that.  Well, what I heard on TV was an interview with someone, a former
appointee to the US Supreme Court who was rejected by Congress (that's a
long story in itself), but nevertheless has some credentials as a legal
scholar.  He was talking about how US Supreme Court Justices sometimes cite
for guidance the law or constitutions of other countries, including Israel.
Then he referred to Israel's constitution as "giving short shrift to the
Orthodox."  He said this is part of a "Post-Zionist" tendency in Israel.  I
have heard from time to time that challenges occur to some of the laws
favoring the orthodox as being unconstitutional.  Is the composition of the
Israel Supreme Court a matter of continuing interest in politics?  What is
the size of the court, and are justices, as in the US, appointed for life by
the Prime Minister and confirmed by the Legislature?

    Another thing I meant to comment on:
<<... voicing this opinion among his fellow Jewish friends, because some of
them were quite pro-Zionist zealots.....>>
    Probably the most vocal of the American Jews do tend to be pro-Zionist
zealots.  It's hard to say what the prevailing opinion is.  My guess is that
there is a large "silent majority" who are not zealots, most of whom don't
think about the question very seriously, and including a few who are
anti-Zionist (or "post-Zionist") zealots, but who seldom speak out very
forcefully.  I. e., it is not "politically correct" in American Jewry to be
vigorous anti-Zionist (or non-Zionist, or post-Zionist).

    My friend, to whom I have referred before, who is a very secular Jew (an
atheist who holds an annual Seder in his household) is certainly not a
Zionist zealot, but he is a very strong Israeli patriot in international
politics.

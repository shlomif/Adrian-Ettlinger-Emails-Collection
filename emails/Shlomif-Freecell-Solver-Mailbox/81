Hi Shlomi,

    Writng early on this date, I'm prompted to ask this.  Something for some
reason it's never occurred to me to be curious about.  Is December 25 in
Israel just another regular business day?  Is one of the days of Chanukah
substituted as a national holiday?

    Looking over your list of sample presets, the longest just happens to be
about 64 characters.  Yet you say in theory, if I understood correctly, that
FCS could accept up to 64K in a command line.  I'd think there would be an
absolute maximum in terms of just how many options can be expressed.  Is
there any reason to allow more than, say, 128 for any immediately forseeable
extension in the range of available options?

    And another question.  Your proposed interface seems to require that the
user be given the option of assigning name to each of an array of presets
that you will supply, although presumably a user who wants to compose his
own would have the option of doing his/her own editing or expansion of the
file containing the presets.  What is the object of allowing
user-identification of the presets?  As opposed to you just providing the
designations?

    I may not be able to get to integrating FCS V2.0 until later in the
week.  Despite the secular nature of most of my extended family, we'll have
a gathering at the house of up to eleven at a time for some of the rest of
the week.

    Assuming that this is a holiday season of some sort over there, my best
of holiday greetings to you.

Best regards, ----------Adrian

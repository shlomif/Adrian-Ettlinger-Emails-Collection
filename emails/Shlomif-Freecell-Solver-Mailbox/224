Hi Shlomi,

    Before you start tinkering with FcPro, I'd like to do one more step.
I've been waiting for the new version of the cmd-line-chop module, so I can
incorporate it.

    Here's what I intend to do.  This is triggered by your comment that
you'd been thinking that we should keep presets in text files, rather than
incorporated verbatim into an .ini file.  I realized, after thinking about
that, that that is something I can do with very little effort, and as a
matter of fact, I have it coded already.  Under this new scheme, presets are
stored as files with the name "fcsprXXX.txt".  The XXX is a two or
three-character code which one enters in "Mode" field.  As many presets as
one wishes can then be stored on the hard drive with file names conforming
to that format.  The way I have it right now, the hard-coded presets are
still there, and if one types only a single character into the field, one
gets one of the present hard-coded presets.  But that feature could easily
be eliminated so that file names with just a single-character designator
could also be used.

    So please let me have the new cmd-line-chop so I can incorporate it
before I turn the code over to you.  Then I'll be very pleased to have you
take it over.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

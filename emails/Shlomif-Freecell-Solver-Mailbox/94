Hi Shlomi,

    Just a note to say the ball is now back in my court.  Thanks for looking
into #23.

    Where I'm at, today I worked on the code to make the moves properly that
show up in #90, and I wound up with a version that plays #90 all the way
through, and still handles what I've tested of the others as well.  Except
for #23, which is posing a different set of problems for me.  But I do now
see what #23 should do, and FcPro really ought to be able to do it also.
Just needs some more work.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I picked mIRC, the premise being I don't anticipate needing again after
30 days.  If I do, I'll either pay the price to renew or go the Mozilla.  I
have now downloaded mIRC and taken a preliminary look.

    My dumb question.  I see I have to "connect to a server". Does that mean
I need to dial up some phone number, or does it mean it will use my regular
ISP to get to the server?  If it involves dialing some phone number, this
will have to wait until I get home next week, as I don't have a
generally-usable phone here.  Can only dial local and toll-free numbers.  Of
course, if any server has a toll-free number, I could use that.

    Other than that, if I can resolve this, a schedule for tomorrow:  Late
morning my time (US EDT) is best -- say 11AM or later.  Earlier when the
whole family is here, 10 more people, it's a menagerie with a lot of noise
and other distractions.  What time did you have in mind?

Best regards, ----------------------Adrian

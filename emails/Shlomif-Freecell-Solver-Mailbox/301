Hi Shlomi,

    And a Happy Chanukkah back to you.  I thought the proper transliteration
of the word into English has it beginning with "C".

    Very good to hear your news.  I know I have dropped the ball insofar as
my study of Neo-Tech is concerned, but I hope to get back to it soon.

    The Etymology of the word "free" is another interesting topic.  As often
with you, you've posed a "heavy" question, on which I will need a little
time to do it justice.  I do have the germ of some interpretive thinking
that I need to expand on to express with fluency, so give me a little time.

    You might find interesting something I just wrote to a friend who is
highly secular himself, and whose parentage is half Jewish and half
Catholic.  He had wished me a happy holidays as shown below, so I thought I
should respond with an explanation of my extended family's "preferences".
Which I did as follows:
==============================
<<Best to you also, for any and all holidays of your preference.>>
    "of your preference" -- we just sort of treat Xmas as a secular folk
festival.  My son's family is totally secular, as are Carol and I.  My
daughter's family is sort of "eclectic".  My granddaughter is an interesting
case in point.  She's surrounded by Catholic relatives.  So she sees what
her cousins reap from going through various stages of Catholic education, in
terms of confirmation parties with lots of gifts, etc.  Her older brother
has been dutifully going through all the Catholic schooling.  Note, this is
not because of my son-in-law -- he's seems to be more of a "lapsed" Catholic
than anything else.  But the girl, after starting with "CCD" as they call
it, after a year said "What's the point?" and quit.  At her present age
there is a point, because when she graduates from some phase of it or other,
it's an extra Christmas.  So for her, it's the economic utility of religion
that's the entire motivation.  This is all mainly at the initiative of my
daughter, who personally is otherwise very secular.  But also, she burns
Chanukah candles and tries to remember to remind us to do the same (she
remembered too late this year).
===============================

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

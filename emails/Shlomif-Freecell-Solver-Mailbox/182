Hi Shlomi,

    I'd agree that hard-coding the presets is not fundamentally a good idea,
but the way I have done it, use of the hard-coded presets is strictly an
option.  The way I have it now, if one specifies a code "1", "2", or any
alpha character from "A" to "O", one gets a hard-coded preset.  If one
specifies "X", it retrieves the preset in the "fcspres.txt" file.  If one
has nothing specified, or an invalid character, it defaults to the default
preset.  I suppose it would make you happier if I made it so it defaulted to
the saved fcspres.txt file for invalid characters, so I'll change it to
operate that way.  Then, only in the absence of an fcspres.txt file would it
default to the default preset.  I feel this is a good approach to the
"product" design for users who may not wish to delve into all the
complexities of preset design.

    My question about the use of atomic moves was due to an apprehension
that it might not be as easy to find atomic-move presets to overcome
intractability problems than with the previous system.  But what you say is
reassuring, and I gather you feel that a repertoire of presets can be
designed using atomic moves that would be just as effective for speed as is
the non-atomic-moves system.  No hurry for the meta-scan to seek out an
ideal set of presets.

<<Do you know how to work with ini files?>>
    I've never actually designed anything where I used files with the
extender ".ini".  But it seems to me I am accomplishing the equivalent by
the use of files for which I make the extender ".txt".  Although perhaps I
am not using the conventional format which is normally employed for .ini
files.  Perhaps another manifestation of my "native" approach to software
creation.  Did that make sense?

    I have a question as to terminology with respect to presets.  I've seen
now two character arrays from you, one consisting of eight lines (the more
recent one), and one consisting of seven lines.  Is each line what you would
refer to as a "preset".  Or is the group of eight the "preset"?  What term
can we apply to each single line to distinguish it from the group of eight
lines?

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

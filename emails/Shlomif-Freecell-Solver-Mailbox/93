Hi Shlomi,

<<Excellent. Don't you think refactoring is fun? >>
    Whatever it was, yes, it was fun.  But just what is the definition of
the word "refactoring" as it applies here?

    Thanks very much for the tip as to how I can diagnose what FCS is doing.
I just went through the process of recovering my recollection of my earliest
experimentation with FCS.  I couldn't find a copy of the command line
version in the laptop where I'm doing the FcPro development, and was hazy in
my recollection of whether I'd ever run it.  I did a lot of working with a
command line version of Patsolve, and that fogged my memory of that stage of
my FCS work.  But now I see that it was in this laptop where I'd run it, so
I can get back to that.  But so far, there is still a puzzle, and it now
applies just to #23.

  The further problem with respect to #23 is that I'd like to be able to
find out just what FCS thought the position was when it made that move.
Because, in the position as I am seeing it, there is an illegal move.

    In #23:
<<Move 5 cards from stack 6 to stack 5>>
    The position I see has no empty freecells, and three empty stacks.  The
maximum number of cards that can be moved onto an empty stack starting with
three empty stacks, I believe, is 4.  Unless there's some manuever which I
haven't been able to design that can move more.  There are three
possibilities: (1) Something was different in a previous move, so I'm not
seeing the same position FCS is seeing, (2) There's some way to legally move
five cards in that position of which I'm not aware, or (3) FCS made an
illegal move.

    In the case of #90, I now see that there's a problem in my code.  As it
stands right now, it isn't properly making the first move.  Also, I had a
blind spot in my analysis, not realizing that the freecell to stack move put
the black five on a red six.  I was thinking stack 6 had to be empty.
Also, it's quite possible that the dilemma with #23 is due to something I'm
not seeing prior to that particular move.

    I'll get to playing with it further later today.  I see for the #23
problem that there evidently is a way I can see the position after every
move, although I don't know how tedious it's going to be to try to find it
for that particular move.

Best regards,  -------------------Adrian

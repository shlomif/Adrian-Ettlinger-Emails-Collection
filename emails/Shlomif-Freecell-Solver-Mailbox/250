Hi Shlomi,

    I did not mean, in the least, to terminate the thread of our
conversation.

    Looking it over, I have a gnawing feeling that I already replied to some
of the points, but maybe not.  Maybe I only imagined what I was going to
say.  Or it might be that you repeated parts of a message I had replied to.
I'll pick out some more things I meant to talk about.

    What interests me most about you is your ideas on "Secular Judaism".  I
trust you saw my comment that I have withdrawn my objection to that term
after seeing the dictionary definitions of Judaism.  But I don't see a
repeat of part of one dialogue we had, where I introduced the word
"humanism".  Whatever, let me express some more thoughts that occur.

    I have to confess that I do not really have much of a grasp of
theological aspects of religious part of Judaism.  But when I try to draw a
parallel between what it would mean to argue for atheism in Israel versus
what it means in the US, I can see that there might be major differences.
For the reason that Christianity being the mainstream religion in the US,
most persons in the US who opt for atheism are rebelling against something
much different from what an Israeli would be rebelling against.  I'm sure I
can speak freely in this company, but Christianity is in many aspects a more
primitive religion than Judaism (here I'm using the word as meaning the
religion of observant Jews, I don't know what else to call it).
Christianity tends toward polytheism, with its holy trinity concept, and
comes, in most of its forms, with a very heavy baggage of a mystical belief
system that is repugnant to any person of intelligence.  (I'm tempted to
introduce Islam for discussion here also, but that would be
counterproductive -- it's a whole subject in itself).  As far as Judaism is
concerned, I have a very simplistic notion of its theology; i. e., I'm not
really conscious of any mystical baggage other than a belief in a deity.  I
don't know, for instance, to what extent the preaching in synagogues dwells
on the concept of orginal sin, or to what extent it dwells on the concepts
of the afterlife, heaven and hell, etc.  What little services I attended
many, many years ago, I don't recall any sermons of rabbis touching on any
such concepts.  So, really, bottom line of what I am saying, an intelligent
person, I would think, would find much less to object to in Judaism than
he/she would find in most forms of Christianity.  Implicit here is the
question:  Just what is it in Judaism that is so repugnant to an intelligent
person?

    I have mentioned you to a couple of other people, and got some
interesting reactions.  I visited my son recently, and he told me he'd heard
of something here in the US that sounded very much like the same notion, of
"Secular Judaism".  I thought you might like to learn somthing about that,
and I have to remind my son that he said he'd get me some more infromation
about it.

    I had an interesting reaction from another friend, who is an interesting
case in his posture toward religion.  His personal belief system is
atheistic, but he was raised an Episcopalian, and enjoys attending
Epicopalian services to see the pageantry.  But his reaction to your
initiative was quite sharply negative, in that in his mind anyone who
prosyletizes on behalf of atheism is engaging in religious activity, and is
tarred with the same brush as the blatantly religious prosyletizer.  I
hasten to say, however, that I do not agree with him.  Another friend who
was party to the conversation, also a very militant atheist, said that she
and her then husband had once gone to an atheist lecture, and found it just
as boring and irrelevant as the religious services they found so repugnant.

    There are a number of different directions in which I've contemplated
carrying our conversation, and the above is just one of them.  Part of the
reason I failed to reply sooner was indecision about just what to talk
about.  I think I'll let this installment rest where it is right now, and
will look forward to your reaction to what I've just said.

    Except, here's a joke that someone just passed on to me, that I think
you'll like.

   At a Catholic elementary school run by nuns, at the start of the
cafeteria line was a bowl of shiny apples.  The nun had put a sign with
them, "Take only one.  God is watching." Near the end of the line was a
large bowl of chocolate chip cookies to which some student had put a small
notice, "Take all you want.  God is watching the apples."

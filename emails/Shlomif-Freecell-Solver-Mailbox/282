Hi Shlomi,

    I will continue the mainstream of our discussion shortly.  I think we
are getting somewhat off the point in debating whether LFC is good or bad,
but we could continue discussing it as a sideline.

    I'm writing at the moment to ask you about something I just happened to
hear on TV.  One of our public service channels was running a tape of the
opening session of the Knesset, and PM Sharon's speech (with simultaneous
translation to English).  I heard him make a reference to the "abolition of
the Ministry of Religion".  If I understood that correctly, I'd think that
would be something that would be good news to you.  Are you up to date on
this story?  If so, what does it mean?

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

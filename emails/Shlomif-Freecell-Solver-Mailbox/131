Hi Shlomi,

    Now I get it.  When you gave me the example preset broken up with "\"
and new lines, that was just to make it more human-readable, and the actual
command line itself is supposed to have only space characters separating the
options and their arguments.  And every new option begins with a "-"
character, some of which are followed by white space plus an argument, some
of which have no arguments.

    So I can leave my code just as it is, and simply in the text editor when
I prepare the preset .txt file, change it into a single line.

    Assuming I do that, is it any big problem for you go show me the code I
need to use?  It'll take you less time than it would me to figure it out.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I've been tied up with other things, but am now ready to start work on
the new interface function.

    I don't really understand the "char * * argv/int argc pair".  I hope
this is something I can ignore for the time being.  Does this have to do
with the sort of scripting function we discussed previously?  That's
something that should be on our agenda, but let me first try to get the new
move system working.

    You say:"A stack->stack move now outputs a "v[hex digit]" on every move"
This was expected to be used only for moves to an empty stack.  Is it going
to be there for moves also to an occupied stack?  If it is, I suppose I can
just ignore it in such cases.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

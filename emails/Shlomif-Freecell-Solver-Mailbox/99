Hi Shlomi,

    Just wanted to check that we're still on the same page.  My
understanding is that I"m waiting for you for an interface module.  I'll
remind you that I do have pending some code which can make FCS's solutions
play back in FcPro for all solutions, instead of 70% or 85% as it now
stands.  We'd had in mind an interface for two new things, one to pass
through a code and count of the number of cards moved to an empty column,
the other an implementation of preset for the multiple instance version of
FCS.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

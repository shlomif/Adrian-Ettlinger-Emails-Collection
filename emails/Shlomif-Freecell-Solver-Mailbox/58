Hi Shlomi,

    First, "old business".  It is definitely in my plan that two or more
solvers will be easily usable interchangably for various functions.   Not
sure just what to do for range solves, because shifting back and forth for
each individual board will be time-consuming.  But for "fast solve" from a
hot key, there will be a separate hot key for each solver.

    Yes, I'm aware that Patsolve does not provide source-destination moves,
and we will need another layer to reconstruct them.  But the fact that it
consistently always moves one card will, I think, make it easier to output
M/S Freecell compatible solutions in the long run.

<<I'm attaching here a modified version of fc_pro_iface.c that contains a
function called Free2Solver_get_current_num_iters() that does just that. Let
me know if there is anything else you need.>>
    I just don't see how I could make use of such a function.  Maybe I have
a blind spot here.  But it seems to me that there has to be a signal from
your code.  I'm thinking I might look into your code, find where you
increment the iteration count, and have you call a routine of mine whenever
the iteration count is divisible by 1000.  I could either count the calls,
or use your routine then to retrieve the absolute count.

<<Actually, it's an internal Microsoft module.>>
    OK, my apology for seeming to "point a finger" at you.

<<Are you familiar with CVS (or with Visual Source Safe for that matter)? I
think we could make a good use of it.>>
    No, I'm not. I'm in a rush for time right now, but will discuss
debugging tools later.

Best regards, --------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Interesting to hear "Religion from State" is a theme which some in
Israel adhere to.

<<I think Shinui are an exteremist left Party. Maybe they share my views in
regarding to religion, but I don't think they are a far cry from being
libertarian-like.>>
    I can understand your problem there.  Perhaps the libertarian impulse is
not as prevalent in Israel as it is in the US;  Although here it's held by
only a minority.  It's something of a paradox here.  The extreme
libertarians here cannot readily be characterized as to where they fall on
the political left-right scale.

<<The issues that are fought over in the US are very, very different,
however, from any such issues as they would be in Israel.>>
Can you tell me what they are?>>
    The particular issue most recently in the news concerns wording in the
Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag.  Back in the 1950's, when the nation was
preoccupied with the Cold War fight against so-called "Godless Communism",
the words "under God" were added, so it reads "...One nation under God...."
There has been a long-standing protest by humanist-oriented groups against
this.  It came into play more strongly starting about a year ago when a
federal District Court in the West, the most liberal of the District Courts,
ruled that those words were unconstitutional.  There was a storm of protest.
The populist viewpoint is that the words are OK, and many Congressman and
Senators did some grandstanding against that court.  The liberals on this
issue has finally carried it to the US Supreme Court, and they very recently
agreed to hear the case.  It will be a few months to a year before they
actually rule.  It will be interesting to see how this comes out.  The court
is almost evenly divided but leans toward the "right" which in this case is
allied with the religionists.   If the court supports the wording, we can
count on reading some strong minority opinion on the liberal side.  But it
is difficult to see on logical grounds how the court will be able to defend
that wording.

    Now then, that particular issue relates to a general issue which I have
never really seen described as such, but back when the constitution was
written, it is probably fair to say that the Founders did not intend Freedom
of Religion to necessarily mean "Freedom from All Relligion", i.. e., to
protect atheistic viewpoints.  Back in those days, there were almost no
professed atheists, although there were prominent deists such as Jefferson
and Franklin.  Many issues rest on this theme, whether "non-denominational"
religion violates the constitution.  Courts generally have held that it
does, but nevertheless we have phenomenona such as a chaplain in the US
houses of Congress, who gives a non-denominational prayer at the start of
every session.  And the motto "In God We Trust" is on the money  So despite
separation, there are ways in which theism is recognized by the state.

    Most of the issues that reach public attention, however, are in
resistance to the "Christian Right", including many well-financed
organizations, such as that led by the infamous Pat Robertson, that are
obviously aiming at changing the US into a Christion theocracy.  There was a
major story which was mainly settled a few months ago, involving a very
rightwing religion fanatic of a judge, the Chief Justice of the State of
Alabama, who had a monument featuring the ten commandments place in the
rotunda of the Supreme Court Courthouse in the state capitol.  Eventually,
federal courts ordered the removal of the monument, and it was moved to a
sealed room in the building out of sight.  I haven't heard anything about
this issue lately, but the last word I'd heard was that the monument was
still in the building, hidden away, and the other justices on the Court had
suspended the fanatical judge.

    Still another issue is the teaching of evolution theory.  There are a
number of well-financed crazy organizations who try to convince the public
that evolutionary theory is totally false, and that all current life forms
were created by God exactly as they now exist.   I belong to another
organization called the National Center for Science Education, which stays
alert to these activities and fights them wherever they crop up.  Even so,
we have a substantial number of people in this country (albeit a small
minority) who really believe in various forms of the creation myth.

    I doubt that any of the above is applicable to the situation in Israel.
I think if I were looking at that from the perspective of an Israeli, I'd
think the Americans were out of their minds to be occupied by such
trivialities.  But ........ Here's something which us "separationists"
sometimes argue, that could be a case in point for secularism in Israel.
The US is really the only major nation with constitutional separation.  In
most of the advanced industrialized world, there is an established religion
in most nations which enjoys the favor of the State, although there is also
supposedly "freedom of religion" as in Israel.  Yet, despite this
distinction between the US and the rest of the world, statistics show that
organized religion is much stronger in the US than elsewhere, in terms of
the percentage of the population that engages in organized religious
activity.  This of course means that our Christian right is shooting itself
in the foot when it argues against separation.  The evidence is that more
people subscribe to organized religion when the state is not backing it
directly, than do when the state supports it offically.

    Lenin, I think it was, once said "Religion is like nail.  The harder you
hit it, the deeper you drive it into the wood."  But there is a corollary,
which could go something like "Religion is also like a screw in concrete.
It you keep trying to drive it in by hitting it with a hammer, the looser it
gets."  I just made that up.  Maybe it could be improved.

    I took a long time to answer your brief question, so I'll close with
that.

Best regards, --------------------------Adrian

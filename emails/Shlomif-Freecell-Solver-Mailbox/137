Hi Shlomi,

    I'm now beginning to appreciate better why it is I'm so handicapped in
my ability to make use of your code.  As I alluded to before, it's the
distinction between the style of DevStudio and ANSI C.

    You've probably seen programmer's humor writing on the theme of "real
programmers's do's and don't's".  Well, I can now appreciate that I'm not
really a "real programmer", because I've been dumbed down by DevStudio.  One
way I could categorize the DevStudio syntax design is that provides a set of
definitions so that the programmer never has to use the asterisk key.  Such
as "LPSTR" is written instead of "*char".  (Not sure that is strictly
correct, or whether the substitute would be "*char x[]" or maybe even
"**char").

    I have looked further at the chopper, trying to figure out how to use
it, and I'm still stumped.  Another problem is how structures are declared.
I'm accustomed to a different style, and haven't been able to figure out how
to access the data in a structure in one module from another module.  I'm
able to do that in other code I've written, but with using a different
method of declaring and defining the structure.

    I'm "still tuned" awaiting your clearing of the fog for me.

    One thing I have a hard time getting used to is your syntax in putting a
space character after asterisks..  When you type "name1 * name2", is that
the equivalent of "name1 *name2"?  But NOT "name1*  name2"?  Would an
asterisk ever be used immediately following a label, with no intervening
space?  Another way of putting it, can all space characters that immediately
follow asterisks be eliminated?  It seems to me if typed that way, it makes
it easier to understand just what the asterisk is supposed to do.  At least
for me.

Best regards, -------------Adrian

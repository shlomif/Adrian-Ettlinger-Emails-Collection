Hi Shlomi,

    In my morning message, I didn't estimate the time in Israel very well
and said "middle of the night" for 8AM in New York.  With a little more
thought, it must have been late afternoon or early evening there.  Can't
figure that you'd be more than 3 or 4 hours east of London.

    Something still seems to be wrong with Technion's site, and since I
haven't heard from you today, maybe it's affecting your outgoing E-mail
also.  At least my sent E-mails have not bounced.

    I now have the framework ready, with a separate dialog box, for your
solver, so once I can get ahold of the rest of the source, I should be able
to move right ahead.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

Firstly:
<<Actually, I'm an atheist too>>
I didn't say I was an atheist.  Just a person of Jewish parentage who
doesn't participate in any organized religion.  My own philosophy tends more
to deism.  I'm sure adherents of any orthodox faith would regard me as an
atheist.  I'm not particularly surprised at your position.  I have a good
friend, a Jew raised in New York who is an atheist, but observes many of the
Jewish traditions, such as holding a Seder every year.  Sometimes I wonder
if Judaism is really a religion, or more just a body of such traditions.

<<Until I arrive at New-York sometime.>>
    Are you a born-and-bred Israeli?  If so, ever been over here?

    But back to the business at hand.  If you want to "dump in my lap" all
the work of integrating your solver into FcPro, it won't happen for awhile.
I assume you're deep into your next version, so maybe you couldn't give any
time to it for a while anyway.  I took a further look at your site.  You
seem to have provided a lot of flexibility, but I have one question.  Do you
have any feature which will automatically successively plow through a
succession of boards dealt according the standard M/S freecell dealing
algorithm?  And, hopefully, generate a report of the results?  Such a
procedure would be an excellent way to compare the FcPro solver with yours.
I'd be interested in a speed comparison, and also this is a good way to look
mutually for false impossibles.  Particularly by running such a test with
one or two freecells.

    FcPro, if you haven't studied it in detail, has a dealing algorithm that
is identical to M/S's (we got the code from Jim Horne), and extends the
boards in a natural progression beyond 32000, up to 2 billion with the same
algorithm.  We go up to 8 billion hands, but beyond 2 billion we have to
employ an artificial contrivance.  But testing with boards beyond 32000 with
the standard 4 freecells, or with the standard hands at 1 or 2 freecells,
I've found to be a good way to evaluate the effectiveness of a solver.

     Here's a thought.  At the moment I'm wrapped up in trying to convert
some 16-bit code to 32-bit, for another product, and having a frustrating
time, in particular with respect to the use of DLLs.  If you have some
expertise in that area, maybe you could help get me over a hurdle, then I'd
be able to get to Freecell sooner.

Best regards,  -----------------Adrian

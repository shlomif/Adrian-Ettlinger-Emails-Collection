Hi Shlomi,

    With your help, it fell together very quickly, and I now have a compiled
version with 2.6.0.  Have only done quick perfunctory testing, and it seems
no worse than 2.4.3.  So far I've only used that one "best" preset you'd
given me, and I dont' see a big speed improvement with that.  I ran the
first 1000 M/S deals on my 2.4.3 and then on 2.6.0.  Took 39 sec. on 2.4.3
and 32 sec. on 2. 6.0.  What does one do to get that 3X speed improvement
you were talking about?

    Question is, now that I have it, what should I do with it?  Once I test
it further, don't see any reason not to substitute it on my website for the
2.4.3 I have there now.

    Another question is how can I test it with atomic moves.  You once sent
me one example of an atomic move preset, but it'd take me time to find that
E-mail.  In the meantime, do you have anything you'd recommend I try in the
way of a preset for atomic moves?  I know you've probably not yet searched
for a maximized one, but can you make some guesses to give me something to
play with?

    I do intend to change over to an INI file for saving presets, but I need
to finish another project first, maybe taking 2-3 weeks.  In the meantime,
I'd like to give a little time to more testing, either creating another
hard-coded preset or two, or using the one-preset file storage system I now
have.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

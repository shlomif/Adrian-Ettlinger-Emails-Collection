Hi Shlomi,

    OK, fine, let's wait for a while then.

    I'm thinking I might just take a pass at integrating the 2.2.2 which I
had previously downloaded, just to get myself back up to speed.  But can you
tell me whether the last interface you'd given me, which I think was for a
version 1.7 or so, will still be valid for 2.2.2?

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

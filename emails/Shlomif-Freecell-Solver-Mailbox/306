Hi Shlomi,

    I think it's time to start getting philosophical again, especially with
your latest exposition of objectivism.  That will take some time to compose,
and have some other things to get done first.  In the meantime, thought you
might like to see how my friend Stan reacted when I passed on to him your
comment that Shinui was too left wing for you.  --------------Adrian

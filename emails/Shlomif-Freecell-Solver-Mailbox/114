Hi Shlomi,

    Re the historical geography software, the provision of a user-friendly
system for generation of the data to portray other geographic regions would
be a major undertaking.  The generation of alternate data, as it stands now,
requires someone with a substantial amount of skill and patience in the use
the bitmap graphics software and rigid-format text file editing.  I haven't
been contremplating any work along those lines, because the demand for it
would be very uncertain.  The emphasis on what the customers are buying in
the product is really the data, because information on historic county
boundaries in the US is otherwise accessible only on a very limited basis.

<<Is there any particular reason why it should not be a string?>>
    Yes, because the typical FcPro user would not be inclined to learn to
understand the meaning of the string, and would more likely to remember the
choices simply in terms of "Mode A", "Mode B", etc. We'd pass it along to
the solver in any manner required, and since it's best as a command string,
code would be written to use the Mode A, Mode B, etc. selection to select
the requisite command string to pass.

<<........it is possible I would extend the syntax.......>>
    That being the case, it's just as well to save the preset strings in a
text file, with a very generic format to connect each string to a code
letter, and users who want to experiment could then use any text editor to
prepare the preset files.

    I should be able to download your lecture this evening, and I'm going to
take the laptop to the convention floor with me so I can study it and write
my critique while there.  I generally have a lot of time on my hands at the
convention.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

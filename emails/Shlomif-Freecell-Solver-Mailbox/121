Hi Shlomi,

<<I cannot implement everything I have in mind at once......>>
    No problem, understood.

<<If you want, you can meet me at the IRC on irc.openprojects.net, ....>>
    I'll bear that in mind, but it wouldn't be practical for the next week.

<<I don't take MS Freecell too seriously in the design of Freecell Solver,
since I realized it was quite broken.>>
    I wouldn't call it broken, just limited.

    Very good quote from Gandhi.  Hadn't heard that before.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

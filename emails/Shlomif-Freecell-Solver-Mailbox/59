Hi Shlomi,

    I'm attaching two zip files containing all components used to compile
FcPro Version 6.5, Build 2.  File "fsrc1b27.zip" contains the full content
of the project workspace, and file "fobj1b27.zip" contains the object files
of the components of FCS.  I had compiled the FCS components separately,
mainly because it seemed unwieldy to insert both the c modules and the
header modules into the same project workspace.  So inserted the obj files
into the project separately.

    With regard to debugging tools, I've been feeling a lack of command of
such for some time now.  At one time, I used to use Bounds Checker -- that
was way back when I was working in Windows 3.1, and I found it excellent.
But then it got too rich for my blood when I needed a 32-bit version.  But,
in running down that crash problem, I found the debug mode in VC++ 5.0 very
useful and valuable.  Hopefully, this new file set will work OK for you, but
I'm wondering when you got that diagnostic identifying the file, were
running in Debug mode?  I. e., did you have the Debugger running the
program.  It was when I did that to diagnose the crash that I got an
announcement telling me that the problem was a stack overflow.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

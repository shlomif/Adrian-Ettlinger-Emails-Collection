Hi Shlomi,

    I don't know what you mean by an INI file.  If you can make clear just
what the format of the single line should be, I ought to be able to parse it
into the necessary arrangement.

    And still, assuming I have it parsed properly, I'd appreciate it if you
could show me the code I'll need to call the chopper function or functions,
and to express the two new arguments for calling Free2Solver().

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<<But I have many other variants beside Freecell, and I need to determine at
which variants it makes sense.>>
    Why?  Just fix it up for Freecell for the time being.  Freecell is the
game that is far more widely played than any of the others, so you really
should emphasize efficiency for Freecell.

<<If you send me the FC-Pro source code (the whole thing) I think I can
easily add such a thing.>>
    It wouldn't be that easy.  In any case, it is a goal of FcPro to be able
to publish solutions that can be played back manually on standard M/S
freecell, which does not allow states with unmade forced foundation moves.

    I'm going to see what I can do.  I'll do not intend to maintain
compatability with any games other than Freecell.  I think this is probably
something you could do in five minutes, and it'll probably take me days.

Best regards, -----------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I'd better check to make sure that the cmd_line.c module that I'm
looking at, which definitely has in it the tests for -step and -nst, is
really the one I'm including in the compilation.  Maybe it's something
stupid in the setup.

<<What exactly does the parser return?>>
    I have a trap immediately after the test for the return value which I do
not have available here exactly, but it contains something like
"UNRECOGNIZED_COMMAND".  It's the test that immediately follows the call to
the parser from fc_pro_iface.  And that's the path it's taking.

    I'll probably write again inside of another hour.

Best regards,  -----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Getting back to you right away.  I have some homework to do for a full
reply, which will come later.

<<I think CRefTime() is an MFC object. Does FcPro use MFC?>>
    I believe you are probably correct, and the answer is no.  Out of my
usual impulse to keep things as simple as possible.

<<Send me those boards and I'll see if I can modify FCS so it will be able
to solve them.>>
    That's the homework.  It will take a little time to pull together all
the information.  Also the intermediate position boards.

<<I hope I made my opinion clear.>>
    Sure, no problem.  Another way to put what I'm suggesting is that you
take on the responsibility for the "product design" of the FCS part of FcPro
6.5 from this point onward.

Best regards,  -------------Adrian

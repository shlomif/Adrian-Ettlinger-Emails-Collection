Hi Shlomi,

    The message appended below, from David Miller, the "world's foremost
expert" (IMO) on 7-freecell impossible boards, gives the three of the five
boards that are 7-freecell impossibles, which we now know are solvable with
8.  The other two, named "Ghoulish" and "Magic8" are on Mike Keller's
website.  BTW, we can't be absolutely certain that all of these are
7-freecell impossibles, as Patsolve seems to be "Intractable" with, I think,
two of them, and FCS is uncertain as to whether its lack of a solution is
definitive or not.

    So far as we know as of now, there is no known board which cannot be
solved with 8 freecells.  David will no doubt attempt to create one, and I
don't think he'll regard it as a failure if he cannot.  My own opinion is
that "8 is enough", although I really wish someone could come up with a
methodology for proving this mathematically.  As it stands now, it's
strictly an emprical conclusion.

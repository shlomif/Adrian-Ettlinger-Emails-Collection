Hi Shlomi,

<<Let me know when you make some progress.>>
    Back in my EE hardware engineering days we use to have this witticism;
"Definition of  'in a preliminary state of development' :- 'When we turn it
on, it blows a fuse.'"  That's how far I got yesterday.  I got it compiled,
and it didn't work.  But there's a nasty problem, in that you may recall
that I'd said I had to throw out your original implementation of the "v"
feature for supermove, and substitute my own.  Your changes for "safe" moves
are right in the middle of my changes, and my first attempt to integrate the
two is not working.  I haven't really started work as yet on figuring out
why.

<<BTW, I'm considering starting a series of interviews with various
open-source developers that I became acquainted with. I'd like one of them
to be you, so let me know what you think.>>
    I don't mind being interviewed, but I think I'm probably very much a
maverick, and don't know how relevant I'll be to your purposes.

    This is a "slow" response, as I realize the best time for me to write to
you is late evening here, to catch you first thing in the morning.  I was
just too sleepy at bedtime last night.  So this is being sent mid-afternoon
your time.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I'll keep this one brief.

    I started with reading through the introduction to Neo-Tech.  It was
difficult for me to get much of anything out of it, because it struck me as
largely a lot of vague rhetoric.  I couldn't find much in the way of
statements of substance with which I could take issue.  But here are a
couple.

"The human mind is an organism that does not age if kept disease free -- if
kept free of mysticism."
    That's difficult to accept.  I know at least two atheists who have
Alzheimer's disease, which I think can be classified as an effect of aging
of the mind.

"Until now, the most widely circulated system of ideas has been the Holy
Bible."
    The Holy Bible is not a system of ideas.  It is a collection of
traditional folk tales, which happens to contain a scattering of ideas, many
of which are contradictory to each other.  There have been systems of ideas
derived from interpretations of the Holy Bible, and these systems of ideas
often are in contradiction to each other.

    The other subject I'd like to touch upon in Israel.  The settlements.
Your prescription for what to do about them is one I had not heard advocated
before.  It's rather draconic.  But I'm sure two groups who would like very
much to see Israel adopt that approach would be Hamas and Islamic Jihad.

Best regards, ----------------------Adrian

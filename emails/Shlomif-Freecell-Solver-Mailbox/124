Hi Shlomi,

    OK, now I understand it.  True multi-tasking, then, seems to take a
machine with multiple processors.  I don't think that really interests me so
much, as FcPro is intended for your typical average guy who would own only a
single-processor computer.  On the other hand, Windows pretends like it's
running more than one application at a time, but I'd assume its technique is
to employ some sort of task-switching mechanism that runs in software and
rotates the single processor's attention around successively to each task.
After all, a single processor can execute only one instruction at a time.

    I was incorrect in saying the number of arguments for the former and new
Free2Solver were different.  The count is the same, although the types are
different for a couple of them.  It might be the present implementation is
working only by accident.

    I'd say I'm at a point of diminishing returns in trying to make further
progress with what I have in my traveling laptop, so I'll pick this up again
when I'm home at the end of next week.  If in the meantime you could have
completed that work you were going to do, that would be good.

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

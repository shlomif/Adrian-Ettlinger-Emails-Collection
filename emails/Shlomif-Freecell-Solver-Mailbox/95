Hi Shlomi,

    You do have the up-to-date code for everything I"ve done short of adding
the handling of the extra character to denote the number of cards to be
moved to an empty stack.  And the current state of that code is that it does
not work properly.  Once I get it working correctly, I will gather together
a full set of the source for you.

    (Besides, I don't see how the handling of moves will affect the
multiple-instance feature.  Once I get my code so that it will handle the
move-to-empty-stack variation from a saved solution file, we'll need to
mutually design a feature so that you can transmit the information to me
when you build the solve string, so the feature can be made to work on the
"live" replay after the solution is initially delivered by FCS..  This will
have some complications, because I really will need to have you either (1)
provide the third character only when the move is to an empty stack, or (2)
also provide an indicator that the move is to an empty stack.  I wasn't
going to open that discussion until I have my end of it working for the
replay from a stored solution.

Best regards, --------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    You seem to be online right now, so we are in effect instant messaging.
I'm not directly on line, but can check in every five minutes.

    The first hurdle we need to get over is how I get the command string
into local memory so your code can work on it.  I'll check now to see if
you've answered my question about the INI file idea, hoping we're over that
hurdle.

    I think we should be able to get through this quickly without the need
for you to do a big project.  I only need the format for a few instructions,
I think.

Best regards,  -------------Adrian

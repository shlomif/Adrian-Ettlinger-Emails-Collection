Hi Shlomi,

    Now I'm the one waiting for a response to my latest on our main thread.
I'd asked you some questions, of which uppermost on my mind was curiosity as
to the state of the Reformed Judaism movement in Israel.

    By a stroke of luck, just last night I had an opportunity to get some
information about this, and this might interest you.  The occasion was a
visit to New York, as a high school graduation present by one of her aunts
(who is my niece), of a grand niece of mine from St. Louis (a daughter of a
daughter of my sister).  The niece who's the mother of the high school
graduate is one of a few of that generation in our family who has maintained
some Jewish cultural tradition, and religion in the American Reformed style.
And the high school graduate, of all things, is going on to college at the
University of Indiana's Jewish Studies program, and has the ambition to
become a rabbi.  We had some very interesting discussion.  She's a very
bright young lady, and really seems to have a head on her shoulders (also
very attractive in both face and figure (I should introduce you two some
day)).  In part of our discussion, I asked her what she knows about the
state of the Reformed movement in Israel.  Her impression was most
interesting.  She says her understanding is that what is called Reformed in
Israel is closer to what is called Conservative in the US.  I. e, the
families "keep kosher", etc.  Reformed Jews in the US, I'm now thinking,
might be much closer to what you are aiming at as "Secular Judaism" in
Israel.  I also asked her some questions about theology, and got a very
distinct impression that her own beliefs are very far from what would be
termed a pure theism.

   .  I'd really like to explore this further, and am thinking of making a
couple of contacts locally, including the rabbi in our local Reformed
congregation, who I'm told is a very approachable person.  Also, I'd
mentioned my son having a contact who is knowledgable about "Secular
Judaism" as it is so termed in the US.  It turns out this contact happens to
live in my immediate community, so my son is going to put me in contact with
him.

    I hope you'll find some time to continue this thread in our dialogue.

Best regards, -----------------------Adrian

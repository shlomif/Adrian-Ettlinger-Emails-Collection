Hi Shlomi,

    Guess my messages did not catch you, as sometimes happens, in virtual
instant messages mode.  Here's an afterthought.  I don't know what the total
cost of this Iraq operation has been so far, but an "extra" $87 billion was
just committed.  So let's say the whole thing so far is costing the US at
least $200 billion.  One would think either of the two huge construction
projects to rebuild your area to separate the two states wouldn't have cost
any more than that.  So if the US had anticipated that 20 years ago and
offered to fund some construction like that, we might all be at peace by
now.

Best regards, --------------------Adrian

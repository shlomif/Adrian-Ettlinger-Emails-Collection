OK.

Actually, what I did was render the screen in its proper order, and then
(separately) reverse it. It should work, I believe.

So it's a geneology program?

With fc-solve itself not much. But with the range solver that ships inside
the distro - quite a lot, as it can solve several games one by one. (sort
of like Freecell Pro without any GUI). I've posted a sample command line
of it to fc-solve-discuss and can send you more or an explanation of it.
(freecell-solver-range-parallel-solve [start board] [end board] [modulo of
boards to print the current position] [? optional
--toatl-iterations-limit [limit] ] [< ... Normal fc-solve arguments >] -
in a nutshell).

By experimenting with it you can create various searching themes, some of
which would be more efficient than others in solving the range.

Ack.

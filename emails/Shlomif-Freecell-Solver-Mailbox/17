Hi Shlomi,

<<You instructed me to create a text file with the moves. I can do that, but
I can also store them directly in memory, which will make it safer and
faster.>>
    Everything is negotiable.  Storing directly in memory will, on second
thought, be preferable.  We store the moves in FcPro in a string variable,
as ASCII characters, and the maximum length of the string is 5000 (2500
moves). Because we read out the path of the solution from end to start, the
sequence in the string is in reverse order of how the moves are made to
execute the solution.  But if you would deliver the moves in any other sort
of array, numeric integers or whatever, I don't mind doing the translating
job if you will give me the spec of the format.

<<Do you want to somehow just ask the solver if it solved the boards and how
many iterations it performed?>>
    Well, I would prefer also to get the solution if you have it available.
I've been trying to avoid spending the time to study what you have made
available on your website (being lazy).  Are you delivering the move-by-move
solution in any form as things stand now?  If you are not, let's not hold
things up for that.  I know in our solver, it was a challenging problem to
extract from what's left over after a solution is found just what were the
moves that constituted the solution, and if perhaps you have not addressed
that problem as yet, let's bypass it for the time being.

    Re the info as to whether a solution was found, and how many interations
were used, did you understand my spec for that?  I. e., the return integer
if 0 means hit the iteration limit.  If a negative integer means it was
impossible, and the integer is the number of iterations negated.  If a
positive integer, that's means solution found and the integer is the number
of iterations used.

<<I beg your pardon? The "pure" C code I provide can run on DOS, Windows,
UNIX or whatever else contains the standard ANSI C library. True, the
Windows executable I provide is a command-line application but it's still a
100% Win32 executable. I referred to you because I was looking for
implementing a Win32 GUI for it.>>
    OK, I misinterpreted something Mike had said.  Was equating "Windows"
with "Windows GUI".  So I gather that when executing it as a command line,
one sees the output as text only?  FcPro should make a very nice GUI
presentation of the results.

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

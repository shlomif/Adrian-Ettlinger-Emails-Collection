Hi Shlomi,

        The timing on this is good.  I've had problems with my new main
laptop, and had to return it to Compaq twice, and both times hard drive had
to be replaced, so I lost everything I had in it.  Fortunately I had the
code for FcPro almost completely backed up -- as far as the FCS interface
was concerned, it was fully backed up.  Just today I got the laptop back,
and I'm now restoring the code for the second time.  So I should be ready to
move ahead with integrating FCS again as soon as I get the interface module
from you.

<<If you can send me detailed instructions how I should output the moves for
the new FC-Pro interface,....>>
    I'd sent you a spec, I see, on Jan. 5.  Was able to find it, and here's
a copy:
===========================================
What I'd like to use as the format is as follows.  In the solution string,
when the third character is needed, insert into the string, following the
move to which it applies, a two character group, the first character to be
"v".  The second character will
be a hex digit giving the number of cards to be moved.  It has to be hex,
using "a" on up for 10, 11 or 12 cards, because that many could be moved.
One the examples I found, in fact, did actually have a 12 card move, where
the king down to the deuce were in a column on top of some lower cards.
===========================================
   At that time you said that sounded OK to you.  Any questions, let me
know.

<<I'll also need to work on the presets code, though.>>
    If it's OK with you, I'd just as soon proceed at first with a plain
vanilla interface, without preset capability, to get me back into business.
One thing I did not have backed up was the source for FCS, so as things
stand now I don't have any FCS I can run at all.  I figured there wasn't
much point in trying to reconstruct the old code.  BTW, just before the
laptop crashed for the second time, I downloaded the version of FCS you then
had on the site, which was 2.2.2 and was able to handle the gz files OK.  So
I can do that a gain.  Should I work with the latest source you now have on
your website?  Or can I use the 2.2.2 which I now have saved on a floppy?

Hi Shlomi,

    I now have my latest FcPro posted on a website and was just about to
send an announcement message to your forum, when I decided to check one more
function, and I found a flaw that I really must correct.  It should be
simple to fix -- it's just that the "solrange.txt" file is garbling the
elapsed time indication for ranige solves.  So maybe later today I'll be
posting an announcement.

<<As you wish. I'd like to have a choice of several presets.>>
    Last I heard from you, you did not yourself intend to use FcPro for your
own testing.  If that has changed, let me know.  As it stands, there is a
choice of several presets, but only the ones you've passed along to me, hard
coded.  I still don't know who, if anyone, would use the feature of
permitting a user to compose his/her own set of presets.

<<Or a meta-scan preset. Whatever.>>
    If that's the preferred term, it's what I should use.  Would you like to
take a look at how I now have Freecell Solver described on the site? And
tell me where I may be using an incorrect vocabulary?  Take a look at
http://www.rrhistorical.com/rrdata/Fcpro65/   Perhaps I shouldn't make the
announcement until you've looked it over.

<<A stitch in time saves nine.>>
    You almost have me convinced.  I'll take a look and see if I can
understand how to apply it.  I can see that otherwise I'd need to device a
format for numbering the presets, defining their size, and searching for
them in the file.

<<And as my mother say the lazyman works twice.>>
    Your mother knows me very well.

Best regards, --------------Adrian

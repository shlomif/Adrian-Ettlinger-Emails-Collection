Hi Shlomi,

<<Mysticism is defined as: 1. Any mental or physical attempt to recreate,
evade, or alter reality through dishonesty, rationalizations, non
sequiturs, emotions, deceptions, or force. 2. Any attempt to use the mind to
create reality rather than to identify and integrate reality.>>
    Well, I just have to say that this kind of definition is so broad that
virtually any mental activity can be seen as relying on mysticism.  Or put
another way, any person can accuse any other person of employing mysticism.
Let's look at some of those words.

"dishonesty"
    Suppose we apply that to a material subject we've been discussing -- the
settlements.  People were encouraged to move into settlements.  Now, if you
are going to advocate withdrawing military protection from the settlements,
is that "honest"?  Is it "honorable" now to tell the settlers it's up to
them to defend themselves?

"rationalizations"
    What's wrong with being rational?

<<:use the mind to create reality rather than to identify and integrate
reality>>
    This gets down to a very basic epistomological question.  Is there any
reality other than what exists in the mind?  Take as an example the
attribution of motives by one person to another.  The reality of any past
event exists only in the memory of the people who observed it, and memories
may vary.  Bottom line -- there is no definitive way to distinguish between
how much of the reality perceived in the mind is genuine reality, and how
much has been created by the mind.

    Mysticism is normally considered to be defined much more narrowly.  I.
e., as a belief in the "supernatural", i. e., a belief that events occur, or
have occurred, which very clearly violate the laws of physics.

<<There is a part of Ethics that is common. However, the ethics as implied
from the Bible can eventually contradict Objective Ethics by enacting
pro-God witch-hunts, a theocracy, etc.>>
    You say "can .... contradict".  --- Yes, but only to the extant that,
for whatever motivation, people have constructed idea systems based on the
bible which have produced those ill effects.

<<Also, believing in the Bible can reduce the happiness and self-esteem of
the believer, and as such it is also harmful.>>
    Yes, it "can" and it has.  And the Bible can also increase the happiness
and self-esteem of the believer.  Sometimes a reduction occurs, sometimes an
increase.  The question is: "What's the balance between the two effects?".
My own assessment is that, on balance, the Bible and religion have done more
good than harm  It occurs to me, perhaps a more relevant question these days
is which has done more harm, the Judaeo-Christian Bible or the Koran?

<<The settlers have a right to live there (like any lawful person has a
right to live anywhere he chooses), they just don't have a right to force us
to support them
against our will.>>
    I don't understand "force us".  In what sense do you mean?  Later, you
tell me (and this was a surprise) that the settlers number 200,000 in a
population of 6 million.  Wouldn't the protection be withdrawn if a majority
of the 6 million voted to do so?  Do you happen to know the numbers of how
much of Israeli Army is stationed to protect the settlements?

<<Some people advocate forcibly evacuating the settlements, but I consider
it redundant and even immoral.>>
    Oh, so it really is advocated by some, eh?  I would think that if a
majority of the country were willing to subscribe to the idea "The
settlements were a mistake and are a major obstacle to peace.  A process
should be started to eliminate them.", then, while "force" wouldn't have to
be used, enough pressure could be placed on the settlers that they'd all
eventually move voluntarily.  There could be a time limit after which there
would be no more military protection.

<<Also, some Palestnians will still be angry about Jews settling in their
land.>>
    Yes, those are the extremists who are bent on pushing Israel into the
sea.  Likewise some Israels want to push all the Arabs over the Jordan River
(but the Israelis are more subtle about it.)

<<And, moreover, many settlers employ West Bank Palestinians as workers, and
so will need to have some way to get in contact with them.>>
    I'd been thinking of commenting on that.  Aren't there still many
Palestinians who have jobs in Israel proper?  I. e., who commute to work
from the West Bank area (or Gaza?) to jobs in Israel?  Or it that still the
case like it once was?

<<The Gaza strip also has some settlements in it.>>
    I wasn't aware of that.  Thought the strip was too narrow to have
anything imbedded within it.

<<Construction won't solve the problem like I stressed before.>>
    That was really meant as a hypothetical exercise.  I wouldn't advocate
it as a "solution", but simply one way to eliminate a major obstacle.
However -- isn't there now going on a construction project in that
direction, i. e. to enhance separation, in the form of a fence?

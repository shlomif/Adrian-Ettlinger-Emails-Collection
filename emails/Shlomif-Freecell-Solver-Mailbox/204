Hi Shlomi,

<< OK, but I'm still not sure that I'm able to reproduce it (solving the
range 10-20 with one freecell works fine here)>>
    Remember the crash we had with 2.4.2, related to the magic number 50?
You weren't able to reproduce that one either. But later you told me you
found some sort of tool on a website, whose URL you gave me, that enanbled
you to run down that bug.

    Still, tomorrow I'll take a crack at compiling a Debug configuration,
and we'll see what it tells us.  I think the evidence that it's occurring on
a "mov" instruction and is identified as an "access violation" is enough to
show that there's an out-of-bounds memory write happening.  It's not too
surprising that running it under DOS (is that what you're doing), the system
tolerates the problem and the area of memory being illegally written into
just isn't causing any trouble.

    I may not get back to you until sometime Friday evening your time.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

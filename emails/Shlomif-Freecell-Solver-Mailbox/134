Hi Shlomi,

    Maybe there's a miscommunication here.  I don't see what the necessity
should be to use an INI file.  Isn't the first step to get the desired
command string into local memory?  I have the necessary tools available to
read a text file of any design I choose, and to create a string in local
memory of the proper format.  Once I have the command string in local
memory, what's the difference where it came from?

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

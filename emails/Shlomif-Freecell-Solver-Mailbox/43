Hi Shlomi,

    That 1 hour delay is interesting.  I'm suspicious that it could have to
do with new security measures on Internet since Sept. 11.  As an example,
when I log onto ATT Worldnet via their toll-free 800 number, there is now a
one minute delay -- exactly -- while it's verifying the user name and
password.  That started shortly after Sept. 11.  The same delay was present
for a time on my local access number, but that has since gone back to
normal.  I don't know where I could inquire about it.  But let me ask you
this:  Do you know for a fact that this delay is not happening from others
with whom you correspond in the US -- or North America?  It's also possible
that it's unique to AT&T.

<<I think I have the Cards.dll from FC-Pro 6.4 there, and it still crashes.
Nevertheless I'll verify that, and I'll let you know.>>
    Hmmm. We may have a mystery there, then.  Are you using Build 61 of
version 6.4?  Do you mean that you cannot use Solve at all, or does it crash
only in the "full solution" mode?  Cards.dll being the problem may be a wild
guess.  All of our past problems from that have been catastrophic, the
program not working at all.

<<In FCS I treat moving an entire sequence as one move that I return to the
user regardless of how many stacks or freecells it used.>>
    Well, maybe we part company on design philosophy there.

<<You can store the original setting of the supermove, and set it back to it
after my solver finishes. That way, the user would not notice.>>
    It's still a compromise, because the solution as given to the user is
still not standard M/S Freecell compatible.  And a solution that is saved in
a file would need to be coded that Supermove was required to play it back.
That's not insurmountable, but I'll table it for later consideration.  As I
said, if I can enable Supermove for playback while using your solver, and
that works, that's at least an entirely reasonable temporary solution to the
problem.  But I'm a bit apprehensive whether it's going to work, as your
version of Supermove won't necessarily turn out to be the same as mine.

    Tell me this:  To what extent have your move lists been used to play out
your solutions?  I'm a bit concerned, before I try it, that a special
version of a Frecell playing program might be needed to handle your move
lists.

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<<In that case, I'll wait for build 8. I got the Zip files containing all
the updates messed up and rather wait for an archive that contains
everything.>>
    If that's your preference, OK.

<<OK, but I think you have it by now. All you need is the function to
interface it with Freecell Pro.>>
    OK, but what I have is version 2.0.0.  Don't I need 2.0.1?  Can you
provide me with that source in a zip?  And do I assume correctly that you
will now proceed to do a new interface file for me?  Don't forget, I also
would like to have a small collection of presets that I can include as
options.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

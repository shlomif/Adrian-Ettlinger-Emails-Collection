Hi Shlomi,

    Your reply was almost like instant messaging, so I'll reply instantly
also, even though I haven't delved any deeper.

    I'll look in main.c for the help language.

<<the correct term is scan rather than method.>>
    That explains a slight puzzlement.  I do see now that "--method" is
always followed by one of the few phrases that you list in USAGE.  Then can
follow other parameters.  Evidently "-step" is the number of iterations it
will try in each cycle.  I don't really need to know what "-to" and "-seed"
mean.

<<So you are planning to use one character to describe them, initially?>>
    I'd say "to select them", rather.  Yes.  I'd been planning on myself
doing a routine to index using an alphanumeric character to select from a
list of presets, maximum size being 36.  But:

<<In any case, I'll work on a function that reads a line from an INI file
and constructs the char * */int pair. I'll have to implement a simple object
to do it and handle the memory deallocation.>>
    That could save me some work.

<<Michael Keller gave an extra nudge to me doing it by saying that he lost
interest in FCS because it had false negatives.>>
    Yes, I knew he had.  Maybe I should have given you a stronger nudge
sooner.  But you might not have been so receptive until now.

    Re the terminology of super, meta, multi-move, my main point is that I
think there should be some term that applies to the formula for the number
of cards that M/S Freecell can move, since that's such a commonly-used
Freecell player.  Internally within FcPro, I have one formula I call
"supermove" and another for "supersupermove", since I once mistakenly
thought my first crack at supermove had reached the ultimate, which it
hadn't.

<<I find it unlikely that the world depends on FCS being integrated into
Freecell Pro.>>
    To the contrary, I believe that the fate of human civilization as we
know it hinges on this achievement.  But I do also believe that we have a
little bit of slack time before Armageddon descends upon us.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

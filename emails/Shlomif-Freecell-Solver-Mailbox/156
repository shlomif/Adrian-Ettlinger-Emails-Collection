Hi Shlomi,

    The explanation:  Very suddenly after my return from Colorado on June
12th, an opportunity appeared for another railroad adventure of a type which
I've never done  before, a "cruise" on a private railroad car.  So, leaving
on the 16th, and returning just tonight, I've been to Chicago and Toronto on
a great trip.

    Your fix for the "safe" moves was received, and I see you'd sent it on
the 7th, just after I departed on the first trip (to Colorado).  And in the
short period I had at home between the two trips, I'd had no chance to look
at it.

    I also see from your most recent message that you'd like to see me use
version 2.6, which is fine with me.  I'll have to collect my thoughts as to
whether to switch over to that first, or try out the new fix first.  I'm
somewhat inclined to the latter, because I had to do some surgery on 2.5,
and I'd have to collect that information before adopting 2.6.

    So stay tuned, and I should have more to say in a day or two.

Best regards,  --------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I continue to maintain that you are using selectively a definition of
rationalization which in not in accordance with the usual accepted meaning.
The full definition of the word (eliminating the parenthetical comments)
from the online Merriam-Webster is:

1 : to free (a mathematical expression) from irrational parts
2 : to bring into accord with reason or cause something to seem reasonable:
as a : to substitute a natural for a supernatural explanation of b : to
attribute (one's actions) to rational and creditable motives without
analysis of true and especially unconscious motives
3 : to apply the principles of scientific management to (as an industry or
its operations) for a desired result (as increased efficiency)

    We are concerned only with definition 2, which has two parts 2a and 2b.

    2a is decidedly anti-mystical.  It says rationalization is the
substitution of reason for mysticism.

    2b does not say all rationalization is invalid, and in fact is neutral
with regard to validity.  The phrase "without analysis of true and
especially unconscious motives" simply eliminates the consideration of
motives.  The process of rationalization itself can be either valid or
invalid depending upon whether all premises on which it is based are true.

    The Webster Third International Dictionary goes into more detail.  Here
the basic definition is "the act, process or result of rationalizing".
The key defintion 2a to "rationalize" is "to make conformable with rational
principles".  Interestingly, however, there is a definition 3 which repeats
the language of 2b from Merriam-Webster, but with the addition of the word
"adequate" so it reads "without adequate analysis".   That seems rather
sloppy.  How would "adequate" be defined?  Does that mean that if the
process of attribution were carried out WITH adequate analysis, then it
would not fit the definition of rationalizing?  Doesn't make sense..

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

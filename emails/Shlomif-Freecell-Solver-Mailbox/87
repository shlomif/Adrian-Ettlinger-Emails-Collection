Hi Shlomi,

    Thanks for the tip, and the news that VCVARS32.bat is a file I should
already have on my system.  Hopefully that's why nmake wasn't working for
me.  I'll try it later on today.  I hadn't gotten to try it under XP, and
it's just as well, as that probably would have been a waste of time.  I had
a bad diskette that I used to move it over to the other laptop.

<<If you set MAX_NUM_FREECELLS to 12, then FCS can indeed utilize 9
freecells.>>
    Oh, OK, I'd thought you might have to do some work to allow that.  As
long as it's that simple, we might as well implement it.

Best regards,  ------------Adrian

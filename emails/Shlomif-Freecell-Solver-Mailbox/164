Hi Shlomi,

    I see I have in this laptop my full download of 2.4.2, so I can readily
go back to the original.

    As I'd said, about half the unplayable solutions (which are only about
1% of all solutions) relate to supermove, and I'm fairly sure those are on
my side of the fence, so I'll work on that once I get the original 2.4.2
compiled.

    The state of FcPro w/ 2.4.2 isn't really all that unrespectable now,
since it plays back 99% of all solutions.  I'm contemplating doing an intial
tentative release of it the way it is.  I have a website where I can post it
myself, then I'd announce the URL on the forum.  What do you think?  (I'm
thinking it might well take us another few weeks to slug our way through the
remaining playback problems.)

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

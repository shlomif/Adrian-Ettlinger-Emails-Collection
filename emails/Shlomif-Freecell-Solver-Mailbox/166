Hi Shlomi,

    In the case of that solution to game #1, the solver's intended first
four moves are (in human terms) 5a 5b 5c and 5d.  Obviously the first four
moves could not be a5 b5 c5 d5, because there wouldn't be anything in the
freecells.  So the last four characters should read a5b5c5d5, so everything
is reversed.  In your example,

a5 b5 67 3h should be rendered as h3 76 5b 5a, per your first guess.

Best regards,  -----------Adrian

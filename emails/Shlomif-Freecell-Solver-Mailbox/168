Hi Shlomi,

    A still further improvement -- #1 now plays back about 100 moves before
an illegal move.  I tried the first ten deals, and none would play back all
the way -- everyone hung up with an illegal move, usually fairly deep into
the solution.  This will take me a little time to work out a description for
you in which I can identify which move in the move string is causing the
trouble.  Would you like more than one example?  Or will just the one on
deal #1 serve your purpose.

    Believe it or not, I'm away from home again, this time in Pennsylvania,
and I'm about to drive home -- about 3-4 hour drive.  So I'll look for a
reply from you when I get home, which will be early evening your time.

    I see you fixed up the "min" problem, but not the other commenting out.
Is there a reason why you want to keep this file with the include fcsolvex.h
and with main() present?  And I see you have inhibited "v1", for which
thanks.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

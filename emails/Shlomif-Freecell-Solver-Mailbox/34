Hi Shlomi,

<<I'm returning a positive number if it was solved, a negative one if I made
a complete scan, and zero if it exitted prematurely.?>>
    This is a peripheral issue, but with an invalid position having been
transmitted, you don't really return anything, because your code is testing
for four different values of "verdict", but you are receiving some other
value, so you're returning a wild number, which just happens to be a very
high positive number.  I could patch it to default to a -1, let's say, which
I could announce as "Invalid position".  But I'm next going to see what I
need to do to really pass you a real position.

    If I feel I could use some interactive conversation, I'll try to take
advantage of that connection.  It would accelerate our communication, if we
can synchronize our schedules sometime.

Best regards,  ------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I've been giving further thought as to how to express my ideas relative
to the Neo-Tech presentation as to the relation between "Mysticism" and
"Reality".

    Let's look at this in terms of what sort of "reality" or "knowledge" is
really at issue here.  I'll start by proposing a taxonomic classification of
knowledge, or science.  The three basic sciences, as taught at the high
school level, are physics, chemistry, and biology.  Or we could divide into
two categories, there are the "physical sciences" and the "life sciences".
Firstly, I think we can recognize that we really are not concerned with any
issues concerning what is reality in the physical sciences, i. e., physics
and chemistry.  To be sure, it is arguable that there are philosophical
questions which can be posed as to the validity of various propositions in
cosmological astronomy and particle physics, but there is little doubt that
this kind of question is not what is on the mind of the promulgators of
Neo-Tech, and you and I.  We are concerned primarily, if not exclusively,
with the problem of identifying mysticism and reality with respect to
various branches of the life sciences, including psychology, sociology,
political science and economics.

    Now then, suppose we begin by searching for the kind of statements that
can be made in the realm of these life sciences which clearly represent
"reality".  To be sure, there are some statements which can be said to
represent reality.  One category is the classificatory or statistical.  If
you say there are 14 men and 13 women in your class, that's reality.  If you
say 15 answered "yes" and 12 answered "no" when asked for an opinion, that's
"reality".  These are elementary examples of some of the activity of the
life sciences.  But they are really trivial.  The kind of questions on which
we find differences of opinion are not that easy to define.  You and I have
debated LFC, for example.  But let's try to restrict this question initially
to what should be an elementary level of life science.  Suppose we look at
the science dealing with individual human behavior -- psychology.  How can
one determine what is reality in the science of psychology, and what is not?
Here's a question I'll pose -- how about Freudian psychology.  Are Freud's
ideas "reality" or are they based on "mysticism".  How can such a question
be answered?

    My "bottom line" to this thread of argument is that if we were to try to
take Neo-Tech and attempt to apply it to the kinds of questions that are
most important in the area of human relations, and the area of human group
behavior, we will find it virtually impossible to make any practical use of
the concepts of Neo-Tech to sort out reality from mysticism with respect to
the most important questions which arise in human affairs.

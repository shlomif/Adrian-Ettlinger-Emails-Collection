Hi Shlomi,

    Yes, there's something going on with respect to non-standard handling of
line breaks.

    When I take the Abra Kadabra file of yours and view it in Windows
NotePad, I don't see any line breaks -- the text all runs together as if
there are none.  When I view the file in Windows WordPad, it does come out
formatted neatly so I can see all the lines properly formatted.  Hence, of
course, it's more desirable to deal with the file using WordPad.

    I need to edit the file by removing your range solve command to make it
usable with FcPro.

    Now then, this is interesting.  When I edit out that line using NotePad,
and resave the file with just that range line removed, but all the
backslashes still in the file, the resultant preset file works OK.

    But if I use WordPad to edit out that line, and then resave it, it
doesn't work if the backslashes are in the file.  (It does with the
backslashes removed).  And the backslashes appear to all be at the end of
the lines, i. e., a cursor advance on the backslash character sends the
cursor to the next line.

    It must be that WordPad is altering the line break sequence, and turning
it into something you're not expecting.  It wasn't very convenient for me to
get a copy of the WordPad edited file to send to you, and I'm guessing this
might be enough for you to go on, but if you really want to diagnose it
further, I could send you a WordPad-edited file.  Inspecting these files in
a hex dump would no doubt tell us the story.

    However, to make it really fully usable with complete flexibility, users
ought to be able to edit any files with any reasonable editor they want to
use, which would include WordPad.  Like I said before, is there any reason
you can't modify it so it will reject the backslash character wherever it
might appear in the file?

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Just a quick note to say your last message was very thought-provoking
along several lines, and I really want to sit down and write a
well-thought-out response on more than one of the threads.  But am pressed
for time on other matters.  I'll probably do it early tomorrow (Sunday)
morning.

Best regards, ---------------------------------Adrian

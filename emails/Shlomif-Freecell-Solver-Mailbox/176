Hi Shlomi,

    Not a whole lot to show for the day's efforts, but at least I now have
the feeling that I'm definietly at the place I thought I was when I first
said to you "The ball's in my court."  I'm much more confident now that that
really is the case.

    It was strange, but those two deals I asked you about -- when I fixed
them, I received as a bonus a fix to what I'd thought was a problem in the
"safe move" system.  Now the only problem left that I know of is the one I
attributed to supermove

Best regards,  -------------Adrian

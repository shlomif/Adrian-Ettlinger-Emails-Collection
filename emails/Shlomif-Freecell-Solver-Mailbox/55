Hi Shlomi,

    Sorry about that attachment.  I thought sure I remembered it, but
obviously I didn't.  I did intend to pass it along to you as well as Mike.

    There's a little more I want to do with it, so I'll send it along
tomorrow some time.

    Most of today I was tied up with FcPro related to that crash problem,
trying to figure out why the difference between the compilations on the old
vs. the new laptops.  Finally ran it down.  The program requires a much
larger than the default stack allocation.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

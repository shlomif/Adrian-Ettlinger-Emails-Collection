Hi Shlomi,

    I should say something about Bill Raymond.  You must have noticed that
he said he didn't think A* could be used at all to solve Freecell.  Yet you
are so using it.  Also, I'm curious if you are familiar with his terms
"Breadth-first search" and "Best-first-search".  As he describes BFS, it
sounds to me as if it's quite similar to A*.

    Bill is the person I referred to in a previous message to you as the guy
who a few years ago I'd corresponded with, and who had a solver that sounded
very promising, and who became very evasive when I broached the subject of
including it in FcPro.  Mike Keller, in fact, became very annoyed with him
and lost patience.  I wonder if you had any previous correspondence with
him.  I'm not sure how much time should be spent in discussions with him.
>From past experience, it might be difficult to achieve any constructive
results.

    I decided to take a little time to looking further as to what's
available on your website, and I downloaded the bin module file.  I noticed
you make a reference elsewhere to "for the impatient".  Well, maybe I go to
too far an extreme in my impatience.  I woudn't mind doing some
experimentation with FCS, but I didn't find a Readme file to answer my key
question.  Can you tell me, what are the minimum steps I could take to test
a succession of standard freecell boards at various numbers of freecells?
What I would most like to see is a test program in which I could call your
solver as a command line, with a number in the line that the program would
take as a M/S freecell game number, and then it would type out the soution
on the screen.  Better yet, a command line which has two arguments, the
first being the number of freecells.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

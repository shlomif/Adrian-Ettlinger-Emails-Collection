Hi Shlomi,

<<If you see that the number of iterations is equal to the limit you set to
it, you can assume it was not solved because of reason #2.>>
    Let's defer further discussion of this question.  Once I get your solver
running under FcPro, there will be some matters of design philosophy I'll
want to discuss.  It's premature at this moment.

<<Actually, "Humanity" is a movie screenplay I'm writing on my own. Check:>>
    Oh.  Interesting.  I only saw the excerpts of references to it that
appeared on a Google search, and thought it looked like you were reviewing a
released movie.  I wonder if your theme will be anything like the silent
movie (c. 1916) "Intolerance" by D. W. Griffith.  Have you ever seen that?

    After I sent last night's message, I realized I should have told you
about how I'm handling the pointers, as we might have anticipated problems I
might encounter.  There are two pointers, the one for the original board,
and the one for your solution string.  My first objective is simply to make
your solver work, and retrieve the return value.  For that, of course, the
pointer to the board position has to work.  Now, then, in my code, I have to
both write the call to your routine, and I need an external declaration of
it.  The board position is the name of a structure defined as Position.  I
have this argument declared as Position*, and I call it with &orig.  Should
that work?  (It compiles OK, obviously).

    With respect to the solution string, the requirements of VC++ 4.0 do not
seem to permit me to use the syntax you suggested.  Your routine has that
argument defined as char * *.  First question, do the spaces have any
effect?  Would it be the same if typed as char** ?  In any case, I do not
seem to be able to find any combination of syntax that will compile in my
code.  The problem might be that I want to point you to a string array which
is declares as char FCSolveMoves[].  Whatever I do by way of declaring the
external as char**, char* and calling it as &FCSolveMoves gives me a
diagnostic like "different levels of indirection".  The way I got it to
compile was by declaring it as LPSTR and calling it as (LPSTR)FCSolveMoves.
I'm apprehensive that this might cause you to write out of bounds and make
it crash.  If that happens, I'll want to disable your use of the pointer
temporarily, just so I can test whether I can make the solver work at all by
passing the board position properly.  Are you familiar with the LPSTR data
type from C++ ?.  Of course, if the board pointer isn't really pointing to a
board, I assume your solver will attempt to report back "invalid position"
or whatever.

    I'm sending this at about 1:30PM your time, so if you happen to be on
line soon after, and can address these two questions, it might accelerate my
efforts if we could telescope the communications process by your telling me
what I've done wrong before I report whether it works.  It's going to take
me at least an hour or two, maybe longer, to do the work I still have to do
on my side of the fence to where I can test it.

Best regards,  -------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I'm curious to know more about what's happening as regards the Ministry
of Religion.  Doing a web search, I found the following:
==================================
Chris McGreal in Jerusalem
Saturday February 22, 2003
The Guardian

Ariel Sharon is poised to end the "political blackmail" of Israel's
ultra-orthodox religious politicians after a secular party agreed to join
his government yesterday in return for the abolition of the ministry of
religion and some despised religious laws.
==================================
    Now then, I thought in Sharon's recent talk he referred to that
abolition as if it had already occurred, but I'm not sure.  But, according
to this, there was pending back in February a definite turn by Sharon away
from catering to the Orthodox and moving in the secular direction.  Whether
it actually happened or not I could not find any definite confirmation.
Perhaps if you know someone who follows national politics, you could find
out.

Best regards,-------------------Adrian

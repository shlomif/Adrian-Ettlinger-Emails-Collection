Hi Shlomi,

<<Very interesting. I know my grandmother lived in Vilna (or is Vilna) which
used to be in Russia, Lithuenia, Prusia, and perhaps even Poland. So
naturally, this program may be of use.>
    That's the same principle, although my software only covers political
subdivisions in the USA.  Interesting sidelight having to do with the
difference between genealogy by Jewish people vis-a-vis the Goyim.  I once
gave a presentation of my software to a genealogy-computer group in New York
City, where most of the group was Jewish.  They were singularly unimpressed.
Which, I realized later, might have been expected.  Jewish settelement in
the USA was overwhelmingly in urban areas.  So Jews rarely care about vital
records in rural county courthouses.  After the presentation, the moderator
asked if I could do the same thing for the Oblasts of the Ukraine.

<<I can implement for you a simple tokenizer .......>>
    We're likely to want to get into something like that, but I have to give
it some study first to be able to discuss it intelligently.

<<...If you take a source X and gradually transfer it into source
Y,.......>>
    I'll agree, that particular point was superfluous.

<<You'll have to ask Don Woods about whether his solver is open-source and
under exactly what license he considers it under. >>
    I'm not going to expect Don to hire a lawyer.  His statement is very
clear and simple.  I have had some past conversation with Don on occasion,
and it became abundantly clear that he has no further interest in his solver
and isn't really very interesting in discussing it from any aspect.

<<My suggestion for you is to distribute the core source of FC-Pro
(excluding Don Woods solver)......>>
    I'm not interested in going that deep into legal gobbledygook.  I
consider whatever risk factor might exist in proceeding with GPL to be
absolutely miniscule.  I would not be complying with GPL if I were to omit
the present solver which includes some patches of Don's original code.

<<....you might wish to read the GPL FAQ....>>
    I have and don't see any problem.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

     I'm glad you replied further on this question, as I was looking forward
to further discussion.

     Much of this hinges on the definition of the word "Judaism", and what
do
you do when you want to know the definition of a word?  You look in the
dictionary.  And when I did that, I found that perhap you were more correct
than I was.  This bears quoting (Webster's Third New International):

 1. the religion of the Jews ............   2. the quality or state of being
a Jew: conformity to Jewish rites, ceremonies and practices : adherence to
the religion or culture of the Jews.  3. the total complex of cultural,
social and religious beliefs and practices of the Jews. 4. the whole body of
Jews : the Jewish community.

    So .. per the latter three of those, your usage of the word is credible.
And here's a very important point you might like to know about.  Per
definition 1, the word should always be capitalized, but for the other three
definitions, it says "usu cap", meaning only it is "usually" capitalized.
Therefore, you might want to consider writing it as secular judaism rather
than secular Judaism.

<<Humanism can mean any number of things>>
    I can't disagree with that.  I suppose I'm thinking about what it means
to the members of the American Humanist Association.  Here is the first
paragraph of their "mainfesto":
"Humanism is a progressive philosophy of life that, without supernaturalism,
affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal
fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity."
    I would hazard a guess that that's very much in line with your thinking.
 If you haven't looked at their website, you might want to explore it.  You
could find some useful ideas there.

    Here in the US there is a substantial number of people who are atheists,
and those who are inclined to organizal activity in support of their belief
are divided into a variety of entities.  I mentioned AHA, and there's also
Ethical Culture, two distinct Atheist organizations and also should be
mentioned the Unitarian Church, where a substantial portion of the
membership is essentially atheist in its beliefs.  How does this compare to
the state of atheism in Israel?  You obviously are not the only Israeli who
thinks the way you do.  How much company do you have?  Are there any
organized groups?  I'm simply wondering to what degree you are all alone in
this.

Best regards, -----------------------Adrian

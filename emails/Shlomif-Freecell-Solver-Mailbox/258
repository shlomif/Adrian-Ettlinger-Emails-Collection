Hi Shlomi,

    OK, guess we're about ready.  You seemed to disappear from IRC after the
comment mentioning X-chat.  So I disconnected myself.

    Do you want to try it again later this morning?  I. e., can you make up
your list of questions in the next few hours, or would you rather wait until
tomorrow to begin the interview itself?

    It's still quiet here for the time being.  One little problem:  Because
of some peculiarites in the sleeping arrangements vs. the telephone
location, I'm now operating the computer on battery, with about an hour of
time remaining.  It might be a couple of hours before I can retrieve and
plug in the AC adapter.  So this might be a restriction.  But I'll try to
check back, say, around 1400 your time to see if you're still hanging
around.

Best regards, -------------------------Adrian

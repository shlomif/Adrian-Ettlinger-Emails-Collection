Hi Shlomi,

    I've received your "Command-Line Chopper".  (crossed with the message I
just sent re multi-tasking)  I need more explanation.  Is this the full
product of what you were going to write to help me out?  If so, I need to
understand better just what function it performs that I don't already have
in the interface module you'd previouly sent.

    Besides, I see I'll need more conversation before I'll be able to
implement the inputting of presets into FcPro implementation of FCS.  Here's
the Free2Solver function as I have it:
==============
int Free2Solver(Position * orig, int NoFcs, int limit, int cmd_line_argc,
char * * cmd_line_argv, int (*signal_step)(int step_limit))
==============
   My first question is whether or not I have the final argument correct
here, as I did a little editing to make it easier to read.
I believe I understand the " char * * cmd_line_argv " argument, and this
will be a pointer to a character string that will be the preset.  But I
don't know what I'm supposed to pass for the " int cmd_line_argc " argument,
although I might guess that it's to be a character count of the length of
the "argv" string.  But....is the " int (*signal_step)(int step_limit) "
stated correctly or have I garbled it?  If that is correct, I'm not familiar
with that syntax, and don't know how I'd be supposed to use it.  Or can I
just make that a NULL for the time being?

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

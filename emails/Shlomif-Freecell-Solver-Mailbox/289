Hi Shlomi,

<<The Neo-Tech constitution reads:>>
    Sorry, but I just have to say that this constitution strikes me as
extremely simplistic and naive.

    For instance, just to take some case of corporate behavior which have
occurred under LFC.

1.  An independently-owned retail store has operated for many years at a
prime location, very profitably.  A large store-owing chain opens a similar
store across the street and sells all its merchandise at half the prevailing
prices, operating at a severe loss until the independently-owned store,
having lost most of its business, eventually must close.  Then the
chain-owned store increases its prices to a higher level than had prevailed
at the independently-owned store.  Does this violate rule no. 1?  Is it
"fair"?

2.  A new company is formed to manufacure a product superior to those
prevailing in the industry.  It must raise capital from the banking
industry.  The prevailing manufacturers in the industry advises all the
banks that if they provide funding to the new company, they will no longer
get any business from the established companies.  Does that violate rule no.
1?  Is it "fair"?

    Example no. 1 actually occurred in the early history of the gasoline
industry in the US, and was a prime method by which Standard Oil Company
(under John D.  Rockefeller) established a near-monopoly over the
distribution of gasoline.

    Example no. 2 happened shortly after WWII in this country, and was one
of the techniques used by the "Big 3" automobile manufactures to prevent the
"upstart" Tucker Automobile Co. from entering the industry to compete with
the "triopoly" of the "Big 3".

    That is a couple of examples of how LFC leads to monopoly, unless there
are rules to prevent monopoly.  In the case of no. 1, government
intervention eventually forced the breakup of Standard Oil, but in the
second, the big 3 succeeded in bankrupting the Tucker Company, and no other
company has ever been able to enter the automobile industry in the US.  Of
course, the big 3 finally got their comeuppance from the Japanese.

<<LFC does not mean a system with no rules. It's just a system where the
only essential rule is the prevention of initiatory force, coercion or
fraud.>>
    The above examples indicate some areas in which rules are necessary.
The question is just what rules are needed to prevent "unfair" business
practices by which large corporations with massive financial resources can
prevent new competition from arising.

    To talk a little more in general terms, I've thought some more about
how, in your mind, you combine libertarianism with a "liberal" outlook on
religion.  What is interesting about this is that here in the US, these
tendencies do not usually go together.  In fact, one type of libertarian in
the US is heavily religion-oriented, and has become libertarian in rebellion
against the conformity imposed by society with respect to religious belief.
I. e., they seek greater liberty to pursue a highly unorthodox religion.
The other type of libertarian is essentially anti-government, and focuses,
usually, on taxation.  They delight in describing how they are working for
the first half of the year for the government instead of themselves.  But I
have yet to meet a libertarian who argues that society as a whole would be
better off with less religion.

    With reference to your prescription for "little if any taxation...."
    There needs to be some way to pay for the structure that enforces the
rules which you agree are needed under LFC.  And in any industrialized
nation,  money is needed to pave the roads and collect the garbage.  And
then, your country happens to be in a situation more severe than anywhere
else in the world right now requiring substantial expenditures for the
common defense.

Best regards, ------------------------------Adrian

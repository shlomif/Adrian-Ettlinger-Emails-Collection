:-) You completely misunderstand the GPL (and you are probably not aware
of the number of changes that have had to be made to "link" the two
programs).  Read the COPYING file.

What you say would be true if FC-Pro was merely *running* Patsolve as a
separate executable (from section 0: "The act of running the Program is
not restricted").  But Adrian is *integrating* my code into his; it will
all be a single executable (section 2b: "You must cause any work that you
distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived
from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License."  This is
the clause that causes people to say that the GPL is "viral").

Although I could grant an exception (by sublicensing it under the LGPL),
I'd prefer that FC-Pro be GPL too.  That's simplest.  Besides, there
doesn't seem to be any problem with making FC-Pro GPL.  Also, Adrian, read
sections 11 and 12, which are the "no warranty" clauses.  Distributing the
code does not mean that you are in any way responsible for maintaining it
or even answering questions about it.  You don't even have to "distribute"
the code, you just have to "make it available".  That is, when you
distribute the .ZIP file containing the executable (which is all most
people want) you just need to include the COPYING file, and your email
address, so if somebody wants the code, they can ask you for it.  You can
even charge shipping fees for physical delivery of the source code
(section 1) although other people could redistribute it for free.

Also, regarding Don Woods' code, it seems that it's been heavily modified,
perhaps to the point where it is "different".  Unless there was something
in it that specifically prohibits distributing the source code, there
shouldn't be a problem.  Especially since Adrian is _already_ distributing
it to people.

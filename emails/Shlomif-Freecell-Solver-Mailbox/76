Hi Shlomi,

    Now that I'm finished working on the Patsolve implementation for the
time being, I really would like to help you develop FcPro into a more useful
tool for studying FCS, and although I've started in on the other project, I
think I could give a little time to getting you started in what you'd like
to do next.  It occurs to me that the part that might take you the most time
would be the "front end", i. e., the modification of the screen and
user-input process, and I'm well-versed in the tools needed for that.  But,
the "back end" is going to take some revisions in the interface routine that
you wrote, and that part of the work I'd imagine you could accomplish
readily.

    So, to that end, I need to ask some more questions about exactly what
you need.  Referring to your last message:

<<The command line box should accept a more-or-less arbitrary-lengthed
string (64K characters is enough). And I'd like the
presets to be a bit more than three characters.>>
    You don't really mean 64K, i. e, 64,000, do you?  How about 64.0?

<<[Presets] Something like 128 characters would be fine.>>
    I'm surprised to hear that high a number, but it really wouldn't be any
problem to implement.  All 128 characters would not appear in the window at
the same time, but an "Edit Box" in Windows normally will provide a
horizontal scroll effect when more characters are typed than can appear at
one time.

    What I'd propose to do, and this, I'm sure, would be no more than an
hour or so's work for me, if that much, would be to provide two new edit
boxes in the "Solve2" screen, one perhaps 1/2 the screen width, labeled
"Cmd. Line", and the other full width, labelled "Presets".  I could also
eliminate the short "Mode" box, for neatness, since I don't see that it
could any longer serve a purpose.  For these new boxes, each would leave a
string in memory, for which you'd know the labels, and you could pick up
these strings in the interface routine and pass them to FCS.  Also, the
strings would be saved and on repeated entries to the Solve2 box, the last
entered string would reappear in the box.

    I won't go ahead with this until I get your confirmation that this will
help, and also just want to be sure you haven't already gone ahead and done
it.

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I've downloaded your lecture and will study it at leisure later today.
What I do during the day is help man a table at this genealogy "show" where
many vendors offer various products for sale.  On occasion some very
interesting person will come by for several minutes of intensely interesting
conversation, but in between there are long lulls when nothing is happening,
which can get very boring.  One reason I like to come to these shows, I have
to admit, is for ego gratification.  Yesterday a woman who is one of this
country's most prominent genealogists said to me "You don't know how much
help you've been for all of us.  You'll deserve a special place in heaven."

    Just as a test case for the value of the preset system, here's a
question for you.  A very tough deal for "vanilla" FCS is M/S #9.   It
appears "Intractable" for as long as I've been able to let it run.  Do you
have a preset that will solve it quickly?

<<The names could be anything the user would like them to have. I like to
give pictorial names to them, but everybody and his preferences.>>
    Now I'm not quite so sure I see the value of allowing names to be
assigned.  For my own purposes, I don't think a nickname I could assign to a
preset would mean any more to me than simply recalling the characterstics of
presets which I would just call A, B, C and D.  I'm wondering if such a
feature is really any more than just a "cute gimmick."

Best regards, --------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    We've now made some headway, but still stuck with a problem.

    Presets are working for single thread.  In fact, I was able to implement
that line you'd given me that solves #9, and that works fine.

    But, the two switches "-step" and "-nst" are being rejected, and making
the parser trap out to the "Unrecognized command" exit.  I'm attaching a
couple of files that I've used for testing, which trap out.  The file
"fcspresa.txt" works OK if I delete the "-step 500" from the end of the
line.  The "fcspres2.txt" file is the one I'd like to use for multiple
threads.  It's based on the example you'd previously sent.

    I've looked over the code in the module cmd_line.c, where those two
switches should be detected, and can't see any reason for the problem.  I
might try to experiment with it further, but my usual techniques are awkward
for working within a library.  So I thought it best to ask you if you have
any ideas.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Finally worked my way through the last deficiency I can find in
playback.  I should do some more extensive testing, and also have some
clean-up to do, but I now have a version I can post.

    You'd said I should integrate version 2.6 when it becomes available.
Any time estimate for that?

    In reviewing what you said about atomic moves, I see that on June 11,
you said the following:
<<The Freecell Solver in the CVS can now optionally use atomic moves to try
and solve boards. That should eliminate all false negatives.>>

    Which version did that apply to?  Not by any chance to 2.4.2, which is
what I now have implemented?  If not, what should I update to if I want to
incorporate atomic moves?

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

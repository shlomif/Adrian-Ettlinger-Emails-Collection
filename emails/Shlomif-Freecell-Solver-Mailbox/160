Hi Shlomi,

<<That's a "poor-man's source control system", and a very bad one.>>
    Maybe I'll move on some day.

<<move.c is part of the internals of Freecell Solver. I'd rather you did not
touch it.  A better way to resolve this issue is to keep a state
synchronized with the current position and use it to check if the move is
made to an empty stack.>>
    Seems like a lot of work when all you really have to do is dip into
move.c to extract the info.  Of course, the disadvantage to my having my own
version of move.c is that if you do an update, I have to keep retrofitting
my changes into the new version.

<<Actually I did not. What I did was render the string from start to end,
and then reverse it in one go.>>
    Oh, ho.  The problem was as if you did the reversing character pair by
character pair instead of byte by byte.

    Stand by for a while.  I'd been having two problems, which was clouding
my concentration on the most critical problem.  I had an additional problem
in that the recorded position in a file had errors in it, in more solutions
than the ones where it wouldn't replay.  I had a breakthrough last night and
fixed the recording problem, so now I can concentrate on the remaining
playback problem.  I have only two examples, #16 and #150, in the first 200
deals.  Also, it seems to be selective, only occurring with certain of the
preset lines.  I need to dig further before I ask you for any more help.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    That new feature in 2.8.0 sounds worthwhile.  I can't go into right
away, because I'm now re-immersed in something else, but I'll keep in mind
for the next round.

    I see what you're up to in the "Better CVS" initiative, and wish you
good luck.

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

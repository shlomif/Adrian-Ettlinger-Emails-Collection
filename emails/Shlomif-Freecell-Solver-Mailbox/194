Hi Shlomi,

<<The message appears on the mailing list's archive on Yahoo Groups:>>
    OK, guess I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed.  Even if he reads
it, he might or might not be offended.

    I'd sent Mike a message back around the first of June in response to an
inquiry from him in which he asked if we should post a later version of
FcPro which was not a Solver Evaluation Edition, and I replied in the
affirmative.  But I had a blind spot there, replying as if I were telling
him to go ahead and post it, whereas I'm now the one who has to do the
posting, since we've got it now on a website of mine instead of his.  He
never replied to that message.  Now I'm in somewhat of a dilemma, and
undecided whether to call his attention to the situation.  I think I'll let
sleeping dogs lie for another few days, anyway.

    The latest Solver Evaluation Edition now has one added feature having
nothing to do with solvers, and that's the capability to initialize to any
intermediate position.  But I can't see that as being of much general use
except for debugging purposes -- I did it only to remove suspicion from my
part of the code re the last bug.  I think that can remain for the time
being as an "undocumented feature".

    BTW, since I've now released under GPL, you could request from me a copy
of the source.  If you did, I'd waive the questionaire, since I know who you
are.  In anticipation of you making the request, I do now have a zip file
assembled containing what I think is all the source.  Although I haven't yet
composed any descriptive notes.   It's a file about 230K in size.  I won't
send it to you unless you request it.

Best regards, ------------Adrian

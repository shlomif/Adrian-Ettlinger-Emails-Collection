Hi Shlomi,

    Focussing vs. focusing.  I don't rememeber the exact rules, but for
certain ending letters of verbs, there is a rule that they are doubled when
used in a compound form.  Like begin--beginning.  Maybe for 's', it's
optional.

<<[rowdyism in the Knesset] There is a lot of criticism of this among the
general public, and some claim it's not a good reflection of Israeli
culture. (or decorum).>>
    Well, yes, I hope as a Jew to a Jew I can say, without being accused of
anti-Semitism, that this is just Jews acting like Jews.  It reminds me of
family discussions I was in during my childhood.  But it does not present a
very good impression to the outside world.  Of course, we don't know how
Arabs would behave, because Arabs don't have legislatures.  Or at least
legislatures where anyone is allowed to speak at all.

<<I'm not sure to what exactly is the Ministry of Religion responsible
for.>>
    At another web location, I noticed a mention that the Ministry of
Religion has, or had, four departments, Jewish, Christian, Muslim and Drize.
What is interesting about this is that while Israel has "Freedom of
Religion", like the US, on the other hand, unlike the US, it does not have
"Separation of Church and State".  In Israel, religion has been regulated by
the state.  Evidently the four major divisions of the Ministry regulated the
four major religiions.  That leave the question, what is the status of a
Hindu or a Buddhist who happens to live in Israel?  I would imagine that
there are still some instruments by which the Israeli government regulates
religion, it's just not structured in a ministry any more.

    You'll notice that also in that report it said that certain "despised
religious laws" were to have been repealed.  It would be interesting to
learn if that actually happned -- perhaps some of the most egregious marital
laws have now been repealed.

    I'll be interested in hearing more about what's been going on there.
Just realized, I could ask my Jewish atheist friend.  He might be following
Israeli politics enough to be aware of the situation.

Best regards, -------------------Adrian

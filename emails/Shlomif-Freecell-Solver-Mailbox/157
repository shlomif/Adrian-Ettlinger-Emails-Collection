Hi Shlomi,

    You're right, the last version I used was 2.4.2  I'll stick with that,
then, until 2.6 becomes available.

    Yes, I have all your message to the forum, and I'll work with those
other presets.  Once we get over the "safe move" question, I'll build more
flexibility into the preset selection system, one way or another.

    I think now my calendar might be clear enough for several days that I
can dig into this again.

Best regards, --------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    OK, I now have a separate project established to work with you starting
from the beginning with 2.4.2, and I'm back where I started.  Bug number
one:

    I have a trap in my code where I first see the move string that I
receive from the interface.  The last eight characters, from left to right,
read "5d5c5b5a", whereas they should be "d5c5b5a5", since the
source-destination sequence as well as the move order should be reversed.

    There is another problem, which I recall I also had to work on, related
to the length of the string, and what I'm getting is truncated in length
compared to what it should be.  But let's work on one thing at a time.

Best regards, -----------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I now have FcPro running with the 2.2.2 version I'd previously
downloaded.  So I'm more or less ready to do a real integration of 2.4.0
(was that the number?) with a new interface module, when the time comes.

    I had to do a bit of groping around.  This time I decided to do it as a
static library, which was your first recommendation way back.  I think I
succeeded, but I'm not sure.  It took a while to realize that I had to
include lib.c for that purpose.  Can you tell me just which source files I
should be using for compilihg it as a static library?  Whatever, I do have
it working, albeit perhps with a less efficient compilation scheme than
should be necessary..

    I don't have the previous one (1.7) to compare to, but from my memory,
2.2.2 already looks better.  Seems on the average to be running faster, and
also I think I'm getting a lower percentage of FcPro-unplayable solutions.
I don't intend to do much experimentation with it, since I'm awaiting your
"real" version 2.4.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

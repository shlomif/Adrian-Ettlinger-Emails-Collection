    If that's how you would describe it, I might then say "How do you know
the theistic element in the Teachings is the key factor?"  There could be
any number of reasons why a substantial segment of Israel's population is
willing to be subject to such stifling intellectual oppression.  The recent
history of many Jewish populations could well have contributed many
psychological factors.

<<The God concept is destructive in most cases.>>
    "in most cases" could be subject to debate.  From a purely "social
engineering" viewpoint, it would take some very deep study to "prove" that
more "evil" than "good" is done "in the name of God".  Although I must
acknowledge that in your part of the world, a great deal of "evil" is done
"in the name of God", but not by Jews.

    You are using the "God concept", it appears to me, in a monolithic
manner, as applying only to an anthropormorphic, proactive God.  Among the
better-educated and more intelligent, the God concept applies in a more
deistic or panthestic form.  It might be nothing more than a withdrawal from
your "Existence merely exists" notion to a general feeling that "There's
something else out there.".  To the scientifically educated, "modern"
physics, such as quantum phenomena and the Heisenberg Uncertainly Principle,
can be used to support such a mindset.

<<But generally, it is unscientific to assume things exist while they may
actually don't.>>
    Is it any more scientific to assume something doesn't exist when it
"may"?  It is entirely a question of plausibility.  To a scientifically
educated person, an anthropomorphic God who micromanages the universe is
highly implausible.  But, on the other hand, an entity which started the
universe by first choosing all the fundamental physical constants and then
pushed the button to start the "Big Bang" is not so implausible.

<<What "ethical and moral teachings"?   I find the ethics that are projected
by the bible as very destructive.>>
    As I've said, I've focussed more on Christianity because that's what I
happen to be surrounded by.  In the Old Testament, there is less ethical and
moral teaching by proportion than in the New.  But at least you have the ten
commandments.  Don't know if I mentioned this to you, but many years ago I
read my way completely through both testaments.  My overall comparative
review after I'd finished was that the Old was mainly "fire and brimstone"
while the New was largely "bright sunshine and bluebirds singing".  Which
could be a major part of the explanation of why Christianity has spread so
widely.

<<It doesn't include Atheism as a pre-requisite. I advocate _secular_
Judaism.>>
    Perhaps, really, all I am saying is that you are likely to have more
success in "converting" people to Secular Judaism than you are in converting
people to Atheism.

    Do you have any acquaintances who are Reformed Jews, and/or who can
articulate the credo of Reformed Judaism as it is taught in Israel?  I think
it might be possible that at least some of the advocacy for Reformed Judaism
is very close to what you would describe as Secular.

    Here is something very much to the point.  A sampling observation about
the degree to which the God concept enters into Reformed Judaism in the US.
I asked my grandniece who has the goal of becoming a rabbi about this, and
this is what she replied:
===============================================
   I have also noticed the lack of conversations and lessons about God
in reform Judaism. I feel that reform Jews are somewhat confused to
what God is. Actually I think everyone is confused on that subject,
but since reform Jews are so liberal in their beliefs, they tend to
not talk about what they dont understand, which is God. I feel one can
be a Jew and not believe in God. I feel Judaism is not just a religion
but also a culture. Therefore belief in God is not nessasary to be
Jewish
===============================================

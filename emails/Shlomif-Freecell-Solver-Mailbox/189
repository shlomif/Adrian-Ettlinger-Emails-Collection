Hi Shlomi,

    Aha!
<<NUM_TIMES_STEP is defined to be 50 at intrface.c>>
    That, I'd guess matches very well with what I've discovered.  Instead of
using debug mode, which I didn't think likely to tell us anything useful, I
dug into the code.  I found, as you know, that there are many, many places
where the free() function is called.  I just started commenting out groups
of them to isolate which particular free() call was causing the problem.  It
zeroed in on the clean_soft_dfs() function call in that same module,
intrface.c.  Commenting out the call to that routine lets it run good, and
as far as I've tested, indefinitely.  I suppose that routine is doing some
cleanup that ought to be done, but most likely it's only a very, very slow
memory leak when we don't let it happen.  Now maybe you can figure out why
it is when you don't reach 51 iterations, that routine does something nasty.

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

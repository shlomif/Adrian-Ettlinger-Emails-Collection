Hi Shlomi,

    If you've replied re the moves pointer situation, haven't seen it yet,
but will when I transmit this.

    For a few hours now, I've been trying to run it, and looking for ways to
find out what's wrong.  I started out returning "Winnable" instantly for
anything.  I had to rearrange some things so I could put in traps to see
where your code was going.  I've determined that the returned "Verdict" is
not one of the values you are testing for, so it's just defaulting to the
exit.  This quite possibly means I'm not passing the position properly (or,
perish the thought, that you're not interpreting it correctly).

    I'm now going to work on ways to put in traps to try to determine if
your code is seeing the position as I think I'm passing it.  BTW, orig is
declared as Position orig, so that part is as it should be.

    It might help if I knew what other "verdicts" might be returned other
than the ones you are testing for.

    Of course, I'm concentrating on "first things first", so not too
interested at this moment in pursuing the moves pointer situation.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

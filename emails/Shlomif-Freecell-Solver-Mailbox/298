Hi Shlomi,

<<"Neo-Tech Advantages"......I mirrored them from the Google Cache.
......upload it to a web-site and send you the URL...... Would you like me
to do so?>>
    OK, and I'll refrain from saying anything more about it until I see
that.

    There's a thread I have been thinking of picking up which will take a
little bit of energy to formulate.  Along the general lines of seeing in
what I regard as proper perspective the role of religion in human affairs.
I don't feel quite up to it at this particular moment.

    I noticed The Geneva Accord got some coverage on TV news last night.
>From the way it was reported, this is evidently something that is being
supported by only a very narrow population of "moderates" on both sides.
>From what reporters are seeing, anyway, the loudest voices are those in very
strong opposition on both sides, who regard it as a "total surrender".  I
could remark that that could be taken as an indication that it is really
very well-designed, if it manages to infuriate both sides equally.  I doubt
that there is really much hope for it, even though it is quite possible that
there is a "silent majority" in the middle on both sides who would accept
it.  The problem might be that there is a strong and loud minority on both
sides who want to go on fighting forever.

    I'll stop this one at this point.  Might write at greater length later
on.

    For family news, we just spent the uniquely American "Thanksgiving"
holiday weekend (four days, as the holiday itself is always on a Thursday)
with my daughter's family on an island called "Martha's Vinyard" off the
south Massachusetts coast.  This is normally a summer resort, so there
weren't a large number of tourists there, which helped made it more
pleasant.  Returned home yesterday.

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    A quick reply before I've really studied the situation.

    Re Patsolve, by coincidence I just received a message from Tom Holroyd,
so I'll communicate with him about getting an evaluation copy.  I gather
version 2.2 has the prunes, but 2.3 is the update that you think might be
free from False Impossibles?  If so, I'll wait until I can acquire 2.3 to
look at.

<<However, it should be declared as "char * FCSolveMoves;">>
    Will give that a try.  Also the change in intrface.c

    Your no. 2 and 3, about saving files and the crash you're getting, I'll
have to look into.

    Re the "Illegal move by solver", I'll have to look into that also, but
since you're seeing so many examples, I think I know what it the problem,
and we might have to have a debate as to who should fix it, you or me.  I
have made it a rule in the design of the FcPro solver that the "language" of
the solution should be such that the moves it makes can be played back
manually on standard M/S Freecell.  Standard M/S Freecell, as we all now
know, does not permit column-to-column transfers to the logically possible
depth based on the number of empty freecells.  In FcPro, it is an option
whether to enable "Supermove", which expands this capability to what I think
is the maximum possible.  But -- we are saving solutions in a form so as not
to require the "Supermove" feature to play them back.  So if your solutions
do require some form of "Supermove", they will be seen as "Illegal moves".
I will have to think about what will be the best expedient to get around the
problem.  There might or might not be an easy answer on my side of the
fence.  Maybe, (just maybe), I could have my Supermove active when playing
back your solutions when running your solver.  But that would lead to more
complications, like how to play back solutions saved in a file.  I'd need to
code the file to identify the "language", another little can of worms.

    Re the animation speed, now that I have an 850 Mhz. machine, I might
agree, but I need to relegate this to a low priority for now.

    Re the playback of the solution, there could be another can of worms.  I
see the M/S Freecell that is distributed with XP has a choice of boards up
to 1000000 instead of 32000.  I hope they haven't changed the automatic
column shift rules, or it would destroy the rationale of my "language"
consideration.  I don't have any op sys between W98 and XP.  Do you whethe
the 1 million change first appeared in XP, or was it also in W2K or ME?

    BTW, the rationale of my rule re automatic moves is that one purpose of
the solver is to show to people who have been unable to solve a particular
"hard hand" that there really is a solution, so some who see our solutions
and are skeptical might want to play out the solution move-by-move on
standard Freecell, so the moves should be ones that will work with that
version of Freecell.

    I'm really awake early.  Sending this before noon your time.  And I do
see you're not observing the Sabbath, as I suspected.  Tsk, tsk!!!  (Just
kidding).

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

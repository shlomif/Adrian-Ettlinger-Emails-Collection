Hi Shlomi,

    OK, I think we're ready for the next phase.  I now have my code revised
to accept that third character from a saved file, and the same thing should
work from the solution string once we get the data added.

    I'm attaching the new .exe, and the updated source files.  I didn't go
to the trouble of gathering a complete set, but just am giving you the ones
that have been updated since build 7.4.  I'd previously sent you zip files
numbered fcsr2101, 2102 and 2103, which provided the successive updates for
intermediate builds.  Hope you don't mind taking those progressively and
replacing the source for the files you previously were sent.  When I do
build 8 I'll gather a complete set.

<<We can keep a current state of the board and play the moves on it. If we
see that a stack->stack move is made to an empty stack, we supply the third
argument.>>
    That's just what I was hoping for.  What I'd like to use as the format
is as follows.  In the solution string, when the third character is needed,
insert into the string, following the move to which it applies, a two
character group, the first character to be "v".  The second character will
be a hex digit giving the number of cards to be moved.  It has to be hex,
using "a" on up for 10, 11 or 12 cards, because that many could be moved.
One the examples I found, in fact, did actually have a 12 card move, where
the king down to the deuce were in a column on top of some lower cards.

    Looking forward to see how the multiple-instance version performs.  Hope
you'll indulge me by sending me the source as a zip.

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

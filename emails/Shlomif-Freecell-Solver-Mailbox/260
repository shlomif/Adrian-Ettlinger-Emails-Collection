Hi Shlomi,

<<OK. Let me know when would be the best time for you.>>
    I won't know for sure until that morning.  But if it would be convenient
for you to stand by around 1330-1400 your time, it "might" be feasible then.
Otherwise, it's somewhat unpredictable.  Don't want to inconvenience you,
but most ideal would be if you could be available for the  continuous period
from 1330 through 1800, although I'll try to flag you as early in that
interval as possible.   If that won't work, let me know what times you could
be available.

    There's a small wrinkle in my use of mIRC, and wonder if you've had
experience with this.  When I did log on and we talked, it took me somewhat
longer than I expected, because I had to type in both the server name and
the channel.  I thought I had saved them both with an "add" for each
previously, and the names appeared on the list shortly after I'd added them,
but did not appear to be memorized after I had shut the program down,
because they weren't there when I fired it up again.  No big deal, but it'd
be a little more convenient if I knew how to make it permanently memoring
the server and channel names.

Best regards, -------------------Adrian

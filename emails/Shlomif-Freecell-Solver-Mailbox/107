Hi Shlomi,

    Two subjects: the "behavior control" and the specs for the interface.

    Re the "behavior control", yes, that is what I recall we discussed
before, and you gave me some homework to do with reference to that.  There,
I see a scenario where we could implement the use of it on a step-by-step
basis, and I'd like to look forward to getting into that in more detail.
But for the time being, I want to concentrate on first things first, so
let's defer that for a while.  I'll get back to you after I've been able to
do the homework, and we can discuss how best to implement it.

    Re whether the "v-" is used for all stack->stack moves or only
stack->empty stack, I really would prefer it to be changed to only
stack->empty stack, if only for the benefit of efficiency.  I don't know how
fast my progress is going to be, but if you could go ahead and make that
change, maybe I'll have the new version from you before I actually get to
using that feature.

    Another question came up when I went to download.  I'd seen your
announcement of win32 files being now available.  Previously I'd been able
to compile your version 2.2.2 from the source, and was going to proceed
along the same lines.  What I saw on your site was the alternatives of
"2.4.2 source" vs. "2.4.1 win32 binary files".  I might have tried to use
the binary files, but it seems they are for an earlier version, and I
assumed I'll be able to work with the 2.4.2 source the same way I did the
2.2.2.  So far I've only downloaded the 2.4.2 source, and haven't studied it
as yet, so I'll reserve questions until I hit a snag, if I do.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Got home later than expected because of a couple of traffic delays.

    It does appear that FCS is committing some kind of malfeasance.  Related
somehow to designation of freecell positions.

<<I'd like to know at what move index exactly this occurs.>>
    If by move index you mean move number, not sure I can tell you exactly.
But I can show you what the move string, expanded to plain language, looks
like.  Not sure this is exact, as certain kinds of illegal moves are ignored
and not recorded.

    You didn't answer my question as to whether you thought you'd need more
than one example.  I'll give you four.  All of these were run with the
default preset.

    In deal #1:
5a 5b 5c 5d 5h b2 8b a8 7a b7
58 6b 65 6h 6h 5h 76 b5 81 5b
a5 85 8a 8h a2 7a 7h 3h 8h ch
8h 4h 3c b3 4b 48 d4 b7 28 2d
2b a2 b4 31 3a 3b c3 b6 d6 7c
7b 73 34 53 2d 27 25 d7 2d 2h
1h 7h a2 62 32 36 1a 1h 13 71
18 17 1h 1h 7h gh 8h 2h 8h 2h
4h 6h 4h c1 8a
    I get an "illegal move" on the "8a", but the reason for it is that the
10th move back is "gh" and evidently it should be "ah".  (my replay
continues beyond the "gh" because it ignores it, but that means the "ah"
move got omitted)

    Deal #2:
1h 4a 4b 4h 5c 5h 4d c4 d6 5c
5d a5 c8 5a 5c b5 c7 a7 2b 2h
2a d2 4d 4c b4 d8 3b c3 2d 2c
b2 a2 6b 6a c6 d6 a2 b2 6c 6d
6a 6b 6h 4h a7 d7 c7 8a 8h a3
1d 1h 1h 7h 8c 8h dh bh 3h 4h
2a 2d 2h a8 3b 3h 7a 7h a3 6a
65 a8 8a 86 8h a6 8a d8 1d 41
82 86 34 38 a3 48 3a 34 c3 b3
a4 3c 3b 3a d3 a8 b8 c8 3d 3h
7a 7h 7b 7h 7h 5h 1h 5c 5h 6h
8h 65 6h 86 8h 43 4h 24 2h 2h
ah 3h bh d2 8a 8h 2b 2h 2d 2h
3h 78 7h gh
    Another "gh".

    Deal 3:
5h 6h 2a 2b 2c 2h a8 7d 7a b7
d2 c2 4b 4d 4c a4 6a b6 5b 5h
7h ch dh 6h 3c 3h 3h c5 3d b3
5c 5b d5 b4 c4 8d 8b 8h dh 4h
5c 5d b5 d8 c8 8b 8d 8c 8h 13
12 1h 1h 5h 5h 4h 4h 42 45 48
4h 74 7h 3h 7h 1h 78 b7 37 28
4b d4 82 5d b5 28 5b c5 2c 2h
45 34 3h 13 1h 21 25 2h bh 6b
62 6h 6h 7h 86 8h 8h 7h 8h 5h
1h 5h 5h 2h 81 8h hh ih
    Just for variety, here it gives us an "hh" and an "ih".

    Deal 5:
2h 8a 8h 2b a2 3c 3d 3a b3 8b
c8 d2 4c 4d a4 d8 6a 6d c6 5c
d5 b4 a4 2d 2b 2a c2 b5 3c 3b
a3 b7 c7 d5 3a 3b 3c 3h c5 2d
2c 23 2h 34 d3 2d c2 32 1c 13
18 c1 82 3c d3 28 3d b3 a3 82
81 8b 8h 6a 68 b6 a8 6b 6a 6h
d6 b4 67 48 4d 48 d7 74 7b 7d
76 c7 a6 b2 d3 7c 7h 7h 13 1h
1a 1h ah
    That's a little different.  Note ten moves back "a6" vacated freecell a,
and then later it tries an "ah".

<<What was your trip about this time?>>
    Railroad history again.  Two historian friends in the area, one visiting
from North Carolina.

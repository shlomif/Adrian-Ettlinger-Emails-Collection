Hi Shlomi,

<<I still don't understand why you have so many problems with tar.gz files.
WinZip handles them very well as far
as extracting them is concerned. But I'll send you a Zip archive of the
source once I code the binding function.>>
    I was just looking for the easiest way out.  See, I didn't even remember
that WinZip was the way I did it, and I do now have WinZip installed, but
now I'd have to relearn how it was I used it.  And figure out where I put
WinZip, as that was the only thing I'd used it for.  In a pinch, if I have
to, I'll do it that way.

    But in the meantime I have this other mystery to work on of the
difference between how it's behaving under W98 and XP.  Regarding that, if
you want to check with Build 7.3 (you evidently wrote those last two
messages after receiving 7.2 but before receiving 7.3) whether you're seeing
what I'm seeing as under W98 or under XP, if you try hands #2 and #20, those
both play back all the way under XP but not under W98.  BTW, of course my
first suspicion was that I'd made a mistake and wasn't testing the same EXE,
but the size and time-stamp match exactly.

    Also, there isn't too much point in my installing 2.0.1 until I have at
least one sample preset I can use with it, so it's probably just as well I
wait for your next development before I move on to the next version.

    The first three hands that don't play back all the way for me under XP
are #4, #12 and #22, and I've now identified what seems to be the one place
in each of them where I need a special function to move an arbitrary number
of cards to an empty column, and I've doctored the solution files to use a
function I'm going to try that will respond to an extra digit that specifies
the number of cards to be moved.  Then I have to examine the interface
function to see if it provides a way to extact this number automatically.
Hopefully, if all that works, I might wind up with a solution such as you
first proposed to make FcPro play back all solutions from FCS.  So, as you
see, I still have enough to entertain myself with for a while before I move
on to V2.0.1 or later.

 Best regards, -------------Adrian

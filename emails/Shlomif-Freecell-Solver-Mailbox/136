Hi Shlomi,

    Good.  What I want to do is simply to use a user-defined text file as
the communications media to provide FCS with a selection of presets.  It'll
be a special-purpose text file.  In the initial implementation, I want to
just read a single preset.  In a later adaptation, I'd plan that the text
file could contain many different presets which could be selected, initially
by a single-letter code.  Sophisticated users could take advantage of this
feature to compose their own text files.  Ordinary users would use a
pre-canned set of presets that would provided with the downloaded software.

    So, anyway, can you just assume that I have a properly-formatted command
string in memory, under the label "fcspres".  And just give me the few
instructions I need to call the necessary chopper functions and then the
format for the two arguments in the call to Free2Solver().  I. e. the second
and third arguments from the end, the two that precede signal-step?

Best regards, --------------Adrian

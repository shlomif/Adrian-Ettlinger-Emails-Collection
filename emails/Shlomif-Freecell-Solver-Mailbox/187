Hi Shlomi,

    Hmmm, this is now even more of a mystery, i. e., that you cannot
reproduce it.  Under what operating system are you running it?  That might
be the reason.

    I gave you the preset with which I am calling it.  I'll collect the code
for the module which does the calling, and send you a copy of the
fc_pro_iface routine which I am using, which only differs from what you sent
me in those minor ways I'd told you about.

    Here's more detail about the problem.  In the seven examples, if I let
the solution play to the end, then back up one move at a time and run the
solver, it crashes almost immediately on one of the first runs.  In most
cases, the number of iterations gets up to 30 or so before it crashes.
Working backwards from the point where the iteration count is 50, it never
crashes when the iteration count is 51 or higher.  In one case, it does not
crash on the first move with a count of 50, but on the second one.
Working back from the end, most of the solutions use 25 or more iterations
on the first move back, but in one where the iteration count mounts up very
slowly for a few moves, staying under 10 for a few moves, it doesn't crash
until it gets to a move requiring about 30 iterations.

    So far I have been running it only under Windows XP.   I can readily try
it under Windows 98, and also 95.  That's probably worth a try.  Something
like this might well be sensitive to the operating system.  If worse comes
to worse, I can compile the library in debug mode and then see if the
Windows debugger gives us a more specific clue as to the cause of the crash.
In the meantime, I'll send you the relevant code, in another message maybe
in 15 or 30 minutes or so.

Best regards, -------------------Adrian

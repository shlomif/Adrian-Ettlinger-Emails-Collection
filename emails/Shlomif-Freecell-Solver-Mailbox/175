Hi Shlomi,

    Just a quick answer to your questions.  I might need to send you a copy
of my module "free2.c", which is in essence my counterpart to your
fc_pro_iface module, where I do the interfacing on my side of the fence.

<<1. How is FCS linked into FC-Pro?>>
    As a static library (assuming that's the kind of answer you want).

<<2. Where is the file containing the presets found?>>
    It's a text file on the hard drive, called fcspres.txt.  Up to now, I've
been shifting from one preset to another by renaming to this name one of a
number of "standard" preset files I now have saved.  These are all single
lines from one of the two the multiple-line presets I have from you.

<<3. Are you sure the shortcut points to the same place as the debugger?>>
    That was one of the first things I checked.  Yes, unless Windows has
some insidious way to deceive me.  But that's really been tested
empirically, since when I modify it, I'm obviously entering the same
modified program from both entry methods.

<<4. Is it the same Debug/Release Scheme?>>
    Another good question.  Yes, I'm familiar with that trap, and I'm
certainly using the Release configuration in both cases.

Best regards,  ----------Adrian

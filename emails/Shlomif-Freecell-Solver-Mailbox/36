Hi Shlomi,

    Great news!  I'm really making your solver work now.  Once I really sent
a position, I got "Winnable" with game #1 and "Impossible" with game #11982.
And it's not crashing, so there's at least a chance that I'm also getting
the moves back from you.  Got to do some cleanup and other work to test
that.

Best regards,  ------------Adrian

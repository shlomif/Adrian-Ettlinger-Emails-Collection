Hi Shlomi,

    Here's some hopeful news.  I tried that new set of presets you'd sent a
few weeks ago, and #16 and #150 played through with no problem.  Next on my
agenda is to set up a convenient way to plow though many deals, to see if
maybe the problem has now shifted to other deals.  Also, to see if I can
isolate that one of the preset lines in the early set of presets was causing
the trouble.

    I'm half-suspicious now that FCS could be delivering a bad move in the
previous situation, and maybe I've been pursuing a red herring.  Stay tuned.

Best regards,  -----------------Adrian

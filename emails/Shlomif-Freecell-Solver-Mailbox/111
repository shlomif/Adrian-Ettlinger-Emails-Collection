Hi Shlomi,

<<Actually, what I did was render the screen in its proper order, and then
(separately) reverse it. It should work, I believe.>>
    I dunno what to say.  I put in a trap in my code to directly display the
moves string, and what I saw was the moves not reversed, but in the wrong
order.  Then when I reversed the move order, I saw a string about
one-quarter as long as it should have been.  I got impatient with it and
decided instead of trying to engage in a dialogue with you to resolve the
questions, I'd rather just go off on my own.

<<So it's a geneology program?>>
    Not a genealogy (note spelling, it's not what you'd think it would be)
program as such, like something to generate a family tree, but an aid for
genealogists.  It's a historical geography source, which shows the
boundaries of all the counties for any state for any year.  Genealogists who
do research in county courthouses often need to know, for a given point in
history, in what county was a given locale, because the county now having
that name is the one where the records would be.  We've been selling this
for about 8 years now, and the total sales have come to maybe 4,000 copies,
so it's not something anyone's gotten rich over, but for my partner who runs
a one-man business, it's reasonably good income, and the royalties I get,
the way I describe it "Don't do much more than enhance my meal money", but
it's still fun, and many of our customers are very enthusiastic about the
product.

<<By experimenting with it you can create various searching themes, some of
which would be more efficient than others in solving the range.>>
    I'll see how far I get, and might try some of that.

<<....it could not be linked against Don Woods solver, which AFAIK, does not
comply with its terms.>>
    The particular copy of Don's source which is in the module containing
his code has this note: "Shareware: Right is granted to
freely redistribute this source provided this notice is retained."  In
addtion to which, I've so heavily modified it that only certain core parts
of it remain.  So I don't see any problem.

<<From what I talked with Tom, he agreed to export the Patsolve source under
a license that would be restricted for use only within Freecell Pro.>>
    I remember some discussion along those lines,  but I wasn't going to
trouble Tom to do anything special, since I didn't see any reason not to put
FcPro under GPL.

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    So this problem with -step and -nst is a mystery, then.  It'll be a bit
of the chore to pull together the entire code base.  I don't mind giving it
to you, but do you really need the whole thing?  I. e., do you intend to
compile it under DevStudio and debug it in that environment?  If you just
want to inspect the relevant code, it'd be easier for me to send you just
the relevant modules.

    It does seem very odd that "unrecognized command" is being returned by
the parser for those commands.  Looking at the cmd_line.c code, I can't see
any explanation for that, as those commands seem to be detected the same way
as the others, the only distinction being they are the last two tested for.
Maybe the most expeditious course would be for me to try to put some traps
into the cmd_line.c code and try to figure out what's happening in there.
Like is it even getting to those last two tests.  Or is that unrec. cmd.
code also returned under other circumstances.

    Re 8.3 file names, that's just a habit I retained from the time when
some of my programs were still being used by people who were using Windows
3.1.  Also, I was using some software, like Norton Commander, that only
handled 8.3 names.  It's still a style I like to cling to, sort of like your
using spaces on either side of asterisks.  Come to think of it, that's a
general style difference between you and I, just like you wanting to assign
names to presets, where I think they can be more easily remembered by
single-character or at least shorter abbreviations.

    I like very much how the single-thread presets work, and I'm thinking
just to play with them I might build that one multiple-thread preset I have
from you into the code as a set of choices (one thread at time) selectable
by a single-character mode key, just to see comparatively how they behave.

    I'll check for a reply from you in another hour or so.  Wouldn't be able
to send you any cod for another three hours or so.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<<Isn't there a way to implement a complete termination of it into FC-Pro? I
think it is a feature the users would very much like.>>
    You know, I think that would really be easy to do, and it really ought
to be done.  So hopefully I'll be able to send you a new Build 6 that does
that in the next day or two.

<<I would recommend releasing the FC-Pro source under an open-source license
in any case. Unless, of course, you have a good reason why to keep it
closed.>>
    About the only reason I might have not to release it is that I'm not
eager to receive a lot of questions about the code that I'd have a hard time
answering.  If I were to release, it might be on an "as is" basis, i. e.,
with a disclaimer that we don't have a tech support department.  But I
wouldn't do it without Mike Keller's approval.  And Mike has fallen into an
uncommunicaive mood, apparently.  He has made no comment on any of what
we've been discussing, even though I've been inviting him to.  Mike has done
that before -- gotten very neglectful of his correspondence.  He has a lot
of interests and I think gets preoccupied with different things from time to
time.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

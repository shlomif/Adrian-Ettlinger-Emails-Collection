Hi Shlomi,

    Last two messages crossed.

    I see the mailing list really works, as I immediately received a return
of the message I posted.

<<In any case, the Iraqi Jewry used to be one of the oldest Jewries in the
world, as most Jews were deported to Babel after the destruction of the
first temple.>>
    That answers one of my questions, since you said "Iraqi Jewry".  Or was
I correct in my assumption that Iraqi Jews fall into the general broad
category of Sephardic?  I know that Sephardic applies most strongly to a
Spanish Jewry, but was under the impression that it also applies to Jewish
populations from anywhere in the Mediterranean area.  Or am I wrong on that?

    But that fascinates me anew, that a Jewish population is evidently
assumed to have remained in Babylonia after the supposed first "exile" into
Egypt.  I do have the sequence right, do I not?  I'm revealing the poor
state of my knowledge of the Old Testament, but as I recall Babylonia is the
first known home of the Jews.  But wait a minute.  Did they go directly from
Babylonia to Egypt?  Without stopping to live in Palestine for a while?  I
do seem to recall that the first two major events were an exile from
Babylonia, then an exile from Egypt, and that the great days of Jewish
history in the Palestine area all followed the exile from Egypt.  Then came
the Romans, Christianity and the 70AD destruction of the temple.

    The friend I referred to, the atheist who holds a Seder every year, is
very up on all that stuff, and lately has been doing some reading on modern
analyses of the historical basis of the Old Testament.

    Almost forgot to address FCS questions:

<<I don't understand this question. Can you re-phrase it?>>
    Re what your multi-testing code does.  After you run it on a range of
hands, is there any place to look where you can read the results.  I. e., if
one were to ask it to solve 11000 through 12000, would it tell you it solved
every one except 11982?

<<I think Freecell Solver is almost as fast going from 100,000 to 200,000
iterations that it is covering 0-100,000. But then again, it's just an
impression and I haven't really tested it.>>
    In our implementation, one sees a dynamic display of the iteration
count, so one can observe the deceleration.  Of course, a lot of this
depends on how fast is the computer, both as to clock speed and disk access.

<<There were also several zero-freecell deals which it could solve and Don
Woods' solver could not.>>
    Do you mean the Don Woods solver announced an "impossible", or just
bogged down and never finished?  Another quesiton this leads to.  I suspect
there might be a later version of the Don Woods solver that I don't know
about.  I saw a date of 1997 mentioned, and I'm sure the one I'm using is
before then.  It didn't used to have a capability for other than four
freecells.  How does one run the Don Woods solver on a stand-alone basis?
This sounds like something else I ought to be looking into.

    Do you have any specific examples of false impossibles from your solver?
Are you interested in collecting examples?

<<Of course, some solvers have options which are different from others. For
instance, in my solver, onc can set the tests order, choose between an A*
and two types of DFS scans, specify an optional optimization scan, etc.>>
    I also have such options.  I need to ask for some enlightenment.  Can
you give me a concise explanation of just what is "A*" ??  Again showing my
ignorance.

    I haven't taken another look at my code.  At the first glance, I
couldn't even locate the one place where I call the solver function in one
operation.  It must be there somewhere.  It really ought to be fairly easy
to integrate your solver, I just have to find where to put the handle.  It's
one of those things, when I do find it, I'll say to myself how could I have
been that stupid.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

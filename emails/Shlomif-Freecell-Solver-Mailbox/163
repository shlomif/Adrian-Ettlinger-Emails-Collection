Hi Shlomi,

<<Interesting. Can you spot what the problem is?>>
    This particular problem seemed to be that a "v2" was inserted for a move
to an empty stack in a position where only one card was available to be
moved.  But..

<<If you can rollback to the fc_pro_iface.c I gave you and to FCS 2.4.2 and
then work from there it would be ideal.>>
    In that particular case, it could also be "my fault" from the changes I
made, so it's probably best for you to work on your original code.  That's
another project for me, to reconstruct the original, and then report the
problems one at a time.  I'll create a project to do that.

<<I can mean-while work on appending the "v" only if there is a move to an
empty stack.>>
    It will be a slower process (maybe) for me to work with you, and let you
provide all the code, but in the long run it might get us there sooner.

<<[atomic moves] No, it won't. It is possible I'll make atomic moves that do
not respect moving safe cards to the foundations. Can't guarantee that.>>
    I realize that.  But it does so happen that the way my code is designed,
it seems to protect itself from being fooled by single-card moves which
leave safe moves unmade, but not multilple-card movs.  One thing that seems
to confuse it, for example, is that if a deuce-ace string is moved from
stack-to-stack.  If the ace alone were moved, it would be able to handle it
OK.

    I think I'll make the next thing on my agenda to reconstruct the
original 2.4.2 as supplied by you, and then give you a report of what seems
to be bug number one.

Best regards, -------------------Adrian

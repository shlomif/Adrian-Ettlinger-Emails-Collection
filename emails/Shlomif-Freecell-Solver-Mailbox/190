Hi Shlomi,

    You can see the parameters that are passed to Free2Solver in the free2.c
module which I E-mailed to you.  Do you need anything more specific?  I gave
you the current position also, in a recent E-mail

    I have the feeling that you aren't going to be able to reproduce the
effect of this unless you run it under Windows.  But also, I'd think you'd
have enough evidence already to figure something out.

    It seems to me there is a very natural fix for this.  Is there any
reason why the clean_soft_dfs() function should be called before 51
iterations have occurred?  The reason for the problem seems to me to be
obviously that when this function is called before the 51st iteration, it's
doing something illegal, like freeing memory that hasn't been allocated, or
something like that.

    I'm feeling tempted either to release it as is, or I could put in a
"fix" that enables the call of clean_soft_dfs only after the 51st iteration,
but I know that would be a crude way to do it.  I looked at the code to try
to figure out just where the NUM_TIMES_STEP constant is used to trip a
count, but I couldn't locate it.  I see you use it to set a parameter, but I
couldn't see where the parameter is tested.  That's probably a more proper
place to do the enabling.  Or maybe there's a variable that can be tested as
a contingency for calling the clean_soft_dfs() function.

    BTW, could you take a look at that clean_soft_dfs() function, or rather
the subsidiary function that it calls?  You'll see ther are two "for" loops.
For the second "for" loop, there is no initializing argument passed, i. e.,
it says "for (;xxxx;xxxx)" (don't have the code right in front of me here).
Is that correct?

Best regards, -----------------Adrian

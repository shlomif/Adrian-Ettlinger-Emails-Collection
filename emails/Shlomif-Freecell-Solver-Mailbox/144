Hi Shlomi,

    I am in fact still in a frustrating situation with respect to how the
code is performing, but I'm fairly sure it's all my problem  It does not
relate, as I thought, to number of cards in sequence.  It is involved
entirely with how I translate your moves into a form usable for FcPro for
replay, and seems to have more to do with the treatment of what for FcPro
are auto-posts.  Which I have to treat differently for your solver than I do
for the others.  What makes it especially vexing is that the problem is
showing up only on hand #16 (out of the first 100), and only on solutions
produced by the first preset in the group you'd send me.  But I think it's
highly unlikely you'd be able to detect anything unusual from your
standpoint.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

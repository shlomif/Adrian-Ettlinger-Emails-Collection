Hi Shlomi,

<<Like I said, my moves contain 4 fields: type (stack->stack, >
fc->fc,stack->fc, fc->stack, stack->foundation,
fc-foundation), source > index, destination index and in case of
stack->stack number of cards.>>
    I'm not sure you have a complete set of rules there.  For stack->stack,
there is a difference in the number of cards that can be moved into an
occupied stack and an empty stack.  That's where the problem was in the
example I showed you.  You are moving only one card from a stack sequence
into an empty stack, and two can be moved, when there is one other empty
stack present.

    I think I'll just leave this matter there for the time being.  I'm still
working on getting my code to make proper use of all moves that require
"supermove".  I have to get through that layer before I'll really be able to
identify the remaining problems. There might be more besides the one example
I gave you above.

<<Perhaps you may need to re-work the FC-Pro internals for that.>>
    It's highly unlikely I'm going to be willing to do that.  We're going to
have to get into details as to just what moves can be made, and exchange the
formulae we're using.  Otherwise we'll be stuck with an implementation that
provides only "results" and no solutions.

    This is going to be a generic problem in interfacing to any solver.
That's why I'd advocate a "standard" that moves in the delivered solution
should be conformed to those possible in M/S Freecell.  BTW, the new M/S
Freecell in XP still seems to have the same rules.

    I'll say this also.  Your solution move sequences, it seems to me, might
not convince a skeptic that you really have found a solution.  Some of your
moves, to reproduce them in M/S Freecell, require more than one move, and
your Mr. Skeptic might not be smart enough to figure out how to execute
them.  I'm not questioning whether any of your solutions are legitimate, as
I see no evidence of that.  But I consider it important to be able to
convince the general public.

    I'm going downstairs now to get back to work, and you may not see
another E-mail from me until tomorrow morning.  Although if I have some hot
news I'll get in touch before then.

Best regards,  -----------------Adrian

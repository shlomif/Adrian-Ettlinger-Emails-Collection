Hi Shlomi,

    How was it left from our last exchange?  I still think I'm waiting for a
new interface module from you.  Or for you to tell me if you'd really like
to see some of my code first.

    I'm out of commission for the time being in doing further work, as the
laptop I was using for development conked out and had to go in for repair.
Not only that, I've had word that they had to reformat the drive, so I'll
have a major reconstruction job before I can get back into business.  Most
of my source was backed up, but I might have to reconstruct what I did for
replay of moves from FCS. I should get the laptop back within a few days to
a week.

Best regards, -------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Thanks very much for catering to my need for "Freecell Solver for the
Complete Idiot"  For both how to use the present version and how to code the
function we'll use for FcPro.

    I'll play with it some later on today.

    Any estimate of the time element involved for your producing the
function for FcPro?

    We'll just have to wait and see whether Bill Raymond ever gets around to
opening up his code, or making his solver available in any form.  It
surprised me to hear he was still interested in the subject.

Best regards,  -----------------Adrian

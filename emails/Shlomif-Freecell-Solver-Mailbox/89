Hi Shlomi,

    New Year's Day.  "Have a Happy."

    I finally got "out from under" on the work I was doing for 8 freecells
in FcPro, and now will move onward to installing FCS V2.0.  I did get as far
as trying out that program VCVARS32.bat, and sure enough, it worked, and I
now have a library file ready for installation.

    While the new version of the program may only be of limited interest to
you (it now handles 8 freecells for all three solvers; still has the older
version of FCS), I'm passing along a copy, and also to keep you up to day on
my source, I'm attaching a collection of all those source modules that have
been updated since the last set I'd sent you.

    I'll let you know when I have FCS V2.0 installed as far as I can take
it, and will then be ready for the multiple-instance capability.  -- and the
appropriately updated interface file.

    Oh, yes, I tried with the present FCS version I'm using to change max.
freecells to 12, but the resulting program still seems to be using 8
freecells only.  Do I gather that the capability to go over 8 is something
that wasn't there prior to V2.0?

Best regards,  ---------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Thanks for the interface.  I picked it up very late in the day, and will
plunge into integrating it into FcPro tomorrow.

    I gather I also need to include some source modules which I should
download from your website.  I should be able to figure out just which
modules I'll need.

    One question, again revealing my lack of education.  Just what is a
".cpp" file?  I know I see that as one type of file that is accepted by VC++
4.0, but I've never used one before.  I wouldn't expect it to be a problem
to be inserted into the project.
Just wonder why it's a .cpp instead of just a .c.

    Hopefully in another 24 hours I'll be able to tell you either it works
or it doesn't work.

    Re Bill Raymond, he wrote to me asking me to reply to you.  As I'd said
to you before, he's a strange duck.  Not sure how to interpret it, but it
seems he's very ego-driven, and wants to make sure he gets full credit for
proving himself to be the champion freecell-solving programmer of all time.
You and I are built different.  But I'm fairly sure his program does exist,
and he did provide some solutions to some 0-freecell games I'd missed.  On
the other hand, one thing he doesn't mention, we found a 4-freecell game
that FcPro solved that his solver thought was Impossible.  But we'll just
have to go along assuming he's got nothing until, if it ever happens, he
decided he can open up.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Yes, I would like to resume our discussion of Atheism, Objectivism, etc.
There are some interesting insights in a biography of Benjamin Franklin
which I recently read, and some passages I'd like to quote to you.  That
will have to wait until I get back home on Oct. 14 (I'm now in California).
Rushed for time at the moment, but I'll write some more from what I remember
later today or tomorrow.

Best regards, -----------------Adrian

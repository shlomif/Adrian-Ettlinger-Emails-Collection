Hi Shlomi,

    Yeah, there's no point in you looking at any code, because at the moment
I can't figure out what the hell code I'm compiling from.  DevStudio has
done this to me before, trapped me by seemingly compiling an executable from
files that don't seem to exist.  I've tried chewing up the cmd_line.c module
whose parser routine I think is being used, but it appears to be finding a
parser routine somewhere else, because nothing changes.

    I'll figure something out eventually.

Best regards,  ----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Just an interim update.  I'm through most of the problems with 8-9
freecell, and have it working for manual play, the FcPro solver, and
Patsolve.  I think it's just a minor problem to make FCS compatible with
it -- it's a matter of resolving the conflict with the use of 'h' for the
foundation.  We use the letter 'k' for freecell no.8.  That looks like an
easy fix, given the way you output the moves.  I was able to get FCS running
OK with up to 8 freecells.  As you suspected, MAX_NUM_FREECELLS in config.h
had been set to 4.

    Tomorrow I expect to get started on FCS version 2.0.  Can I assume that
the interface routine I now have should work OK?  For the initial
implementation, I'd like to be able to specify a limited selection of
presets.  Can you give me a few that I could use, specifying them by digits
in the "Mode" field?

Best regards, -----------Adrian

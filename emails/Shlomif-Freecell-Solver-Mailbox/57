Hi Mike,

    I'm copying Shlomi also on this to pass on the new Build 62 to him as
well.  This has the same sized stack as the old version, so should be immune
from crashing from the same stack overflow problem as before.

    Also, Mike, I put in a kludge fix for the initialization of the card
size.  I made it so that when it reads the registry, if it finds a width
below 20 pixels or a height below 30 pixels, it changes them to 71x96, which
seems to be the standard default.  No one in his right mind would want cards
smaller than that.

    I tested this as follows:  One can set a tiny card size deliberately and
then exit the program.  When you start the program again, if you've exited
with an illegally small card size, it will restore them to the default size.
Before this fix, it would bring back the tiny size, but now it always
restores them.  I'd think that should fix the initialization problem for an
original installation.

    The next version of 6.5 that I do will also have the size fix and the
larger stack.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

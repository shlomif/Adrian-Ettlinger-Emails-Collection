Hi Shlomi,

<<After all my cards can be flourished, I can press the auto-play button and
they are moved to the foundations one by one.>>
    Is auto-play a mode you can leave it in?  I. e., so aces and other cards
that I would call "must" moves to the foundation will always automatically
be moved?  Or would one have to push auto-play after every move?

<<
--
QC 3S
 2H
 AC
 KS
  We move the KS to the freecells and then move 2H on top of 3S. I think FCS
has just a move like that.>>
    Yes, I believe in one of my examples I saw that happen.  However, in the
scheme I have in mind, after the KS was moved to a freecell, the AC would
automatically go to the foundation.  In fact, if the AH was already on the
foundation, the 2H would also go automatically.

<<What's your trip about this time? Have fun in any case.>>
    This is strictly about one of my other hobbies, railroad history.  Going
to Colorado for the national meeting of a society for which I'm webmaster.
Lots of train riding and mountain scenery.  My wife is going with me on this
one.  It's unusual for me to have two trips so close together.  I hadn't
been anywhere else since January.

<<I'll do my best to implement an FC-Proization scheme of the FCS moves that
are being output.>>
    You might finish yours before I do mine.  If so, I'll give it a try and
perhaps abandon my effort.  But at the moment I'm intrigued by the
challenge.  What I intend to do can easily be put on a switch or made
contingent on Freecell being played.  I now see what you mean by the
difficulty of determining when Freecell is being played, and considering
variations such as PySol, it might really call for the sublety of specifying
whether the user wants the solutions to be output with compatablility for
M/S or PySol, or for that matter other brands that might exist.

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

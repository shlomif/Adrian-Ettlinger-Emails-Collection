Hi Shlomi,

    Another stumbling block, maybe.

    I've never run across the ".gz" file extension before.  Must involve
some other compression software, not ZIP.  Why didn't you use ZIP for this?
I've downloaded your "bin" files also, which are zipped, to study them to
see what I can find out.  I want to move to another place in the house where
I don't have Internet access to get to work on it, so this message is just
an alert that if I can't figure out how to decompress a GZ file, I might
need some more help from you.

    I'll E-mail you again if I'm able to solve the problem.

Best regards,  --------------Adrian

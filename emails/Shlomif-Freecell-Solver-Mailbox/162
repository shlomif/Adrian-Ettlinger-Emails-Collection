Hi Shlomi,

    Well, there's still work to do.  And it isn't as simple as one might
hope.  Perhaps one percent of all deals do not play through.  It depends on
what preset is used which particular deals do not play.  Your new preset
isn't really any different from the old one -- it was just a coincidence
that the first 200 deals didn't have a problem.

    To collect a number of samples of deals that don't play, I implemented
an automatic test that in effect does a range solve but plays out the
solution for each hand.  I've collected maybe 15 examples.  Unfortunately,
they are not all of the same type.  Maybe half of them relate to "safe"
moves, the other half are supermove-related.  I believe I have spotted one
case where FCS is acutually delivering an invalid move.

    I'll need some more time to decide what the strategy should be from here
on.

    I think it will act differently if atomic moves are used, so I'm not so
sure how hard I want to work on the present situation.

Best regards,  --------------------Adrian

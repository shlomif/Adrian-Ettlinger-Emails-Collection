Hi Shlomi,

    Thanks for a timely reply.  I haven't reached my moment of truth as yet,
having gotten off to a slow start this morning.

<<You should declare it as "char * FcSolveMove;" and then pass
"&FcSolveMoves" to the function.>>
    I just tried that, and it gave me a "warning" as follows:
'char *' differs in levels of indirection from 'char (*)[]'

    I could ignore the warning and see what happens.  Seems like the worse
that could happen is it will crash.

    Or, something else I'm thinking about.  I see you are accumulating the
moves in moves_string[].  Could I put in an external reference to
moves_string and then use lstrcpy(FCSolveMoves, moves_string)  ?  I might
then also put in a test to make sure we don't overflow my limited size
string.

Best regards, -----------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    You wrote to me about a week ago as to how I am distributing the source
code for FcPro.

    Let's see, how can I put this, without making it sound nasty.  I really
don't have much interest in gaining any "benefits" (or, I should say, have
the code itself benefit) from the distribution of the source code.  From the
experience so far, it doesn't really appear that many people are at all
interested in it.  I've had exactly one request for the code.  When I wrote
back to the requester asking some inocuous questions, like please let me
know where you live and what you want to do with the code,. he never
replied.  It was a Chinese name.  Maybe he's a Chinese government employee
and they have a program of secretly colllecting all the source code they can
collect from the Occidental world.

    If you want to take the code and post it somewhere so people can
download it, I'd have no objection.  I think the GPL license would give you
permission to do that whether I like the idea or not, but in any case, be
assured that it wouldn't hurt my feelings in the least.  I'd be very happy
to have anyone pick up on it and carry its development further.  As time
passes by, I of course would be less and less able to explain any of it to
anyone who might have questions.

    I'm very glad to see you remaining enthusiastic about Freecell solving
software, but I have very much moved on to other things which are  taking up
all of my time.

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

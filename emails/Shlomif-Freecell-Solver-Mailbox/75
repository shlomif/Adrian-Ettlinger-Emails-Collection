Hi Shlomi,

    What we could do readily would be to provide a library of predetermined
mode presets which would be called by entering a two or three-character code
in the "Mode" field.  To provide a full text field is also, of course,
doable, but is more work.  If we were to provide such a text field, how many
characters should it allow for?  Now that I thnk of it, it wouldn't be a
very big job to just increase the height of the dialog box for "Solve2" and
add an edit box which would extend the full width of the box for a "command
line".  Would that be enough space?

    I have to start spednig some time on another project, but will probably
return to the FcPro solver evaluation project in another couple of weeks or
so.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

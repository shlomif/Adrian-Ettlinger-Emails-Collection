Hi Shlomi,

<<<<only covers political subdivisions in the USA.>>
Can it be adapted to other areas?>>
    The basic driving software could certainly be employed for data covering
any other geographical area.  I've had a couple of others flirt with the
possibility, but no serious takers.  I consider the basic code for the
executable proprietary, but the rules for creating the data could be made
public and others could generate data files for a graphic historical
geography of any area of the world.  There is one other similar product of
which I'm aware, which shows the political history of Europe (including the
surrounding areas of Asia and Africa, extending I believe to the Middle
East) since the year 1000.  This other product uses entirely different GIS
technique.  I use bitmapped graphics, and the other guy uses vector.  As a
consequence, my system allow for very snappy timing in shifting from one map
to another, but is limited to one scale only.  The other one is very loose
as to timing, but can be zoomed to a variety of scales.

<<I can send you some of my presets if you like.>>
    Even though I still have yet to do my homework, from what I remember
from past discussion, here is what I want to do for phase one.  I want to
implement it to use a text file that will contain a selection of presets,
and to provide a "mode" selection in FcPro's dialog box for Freecell Solver,
which mode selection will be, probably, a single alphanumeric character.
Intially, I'd just like to provide a choice between a variety of presets
that you would provide.  For phase two, then, I'd just like to provide for
users who want to experiment with designing their own presets the rules for
formatting the text file, in the assumption that any user who is ambitious
enough to do preset experimentation would also be skilled enough to follow
formatting rules for a text file.  There imight or might not be a phase
three which would imbed into FcPro a protocol to provide an aid to composing
properly formatted preset files.

<<I have yet to put my code where my mouth is, so to speak.>>
    Noted, and that's a candid and realistic attitude.  I wouldn't mind in
the least seeing some "competition" for FcPro.

    Re your "lecture", I hadn't read carefully enough to notice what was
really the subject matter, and that you were really hoping for some reaction
from your "peers".  As you know, I'm on the road now and have some other
demands on my "leisure" time which I have to prioritize, so I probably won't
be able to get to it for a few days, but I'll keep it on my agenda.

Best regards,  ------------------Adrian

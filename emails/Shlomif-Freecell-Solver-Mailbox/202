Hi Shlomi,

<<2.6.0 does not make false impossibles .........That's interesting. I don't
think I changed the solving algorithm. Can you validate that these solutions
are correct?>>
    Yes.  I have one excellent example.  A human-generated solution to M/S
deal #7 playing with one freecell only, in which the 3rd through the 8th
intermediate positions are all declared "Impossible" by 2.4.3, but for which
2.6.0 produces a clearly-correct solution.   The solution begins:
47 57 67 47 45 38 73 74 76 71
    After every move from "67" through "74", 2.4.3 says "Impossible" and
2.6.0 solves it.  Note, this is playing with only one freecell.

<<[The crashing] Does it always happen when you run it from 1 to 32000? Is
there any way you can reproduce it at a 100% probability?>
    This is a very time-consuming thing to investigate, and I have to give
priority to my other project.  However, I have a light schedule today for
the other project, so I'll get a chance later today to experiment some more.
I have to wait about 10 minutes in 1 to 32000 for the crash at 11982 in
range solving.   There was one example in the "False impossible" test mode
where on three consecutive runs, it always crashed on the same move in the
same solution, and that was after a wait of only a few minutes.  I don't
know how much good that will do you to know about, or what you'd like to
know about it.  .

    Another odd aspect to it is that in the FIMP test mode, it seemed to
have a tendency to crash the most while working on a solution within which
2.4.3 gives at least one false impossible.  To check that out, I made up a
solution file in which I eliminated all the solutions in that category, but
it would still crash after running several thousand solutions.  2.4.3 runs
through the same file completely without crashing, while 2.6.0 always
crashes before it gets about 20% through.

    About the only correlation we seem to have with this is that going to a
high number of iterations for any given position seems in a general way to
have something to do with provoking the crash.  If I have the time today, I
might possibly try something I'd had in mind for that other crash situation,
compiling under DevStudio's Debug configuration, to see if that provides a
clue as to where in the source the mishap is occurring.  It must be either a
memory leak or an out-of-bounds memory write.

    I consider this a serious enough problem that I don't want to "publish"
the 2.6.0 version on my website until we can get this fixed.  Despite the
fact that the general speed performance and lack of false impossibles make
it look very good to me.

    There's another way to test I should try.  Since it seems to be most
prone to crash while dealing with Impossible or near-Impossible positions, I
should run it on the one-or two-freecell game.  There's a good chance I can
find some more quickly repeatable results that way.

Best regards, --------------------Adrian

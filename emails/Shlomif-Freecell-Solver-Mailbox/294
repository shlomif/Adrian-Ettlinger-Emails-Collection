Hi Shlomi,

<<Yes, it is. Because supplying them with military protection against the
will of the soldiers is dishonest.>>
    "Against the will of the soldiers" ???  People in military service in
any army are expected to follow orders.  I've never heard of any army that
could operate by acting only on the "will" of its soldiers.  Of course, any
army is more effective if the will of the soldiers coincides with the will
of the national leadership, but that is often not the case in every detail.
We probably have quite a few American soldiers now in Iraq who wouldn't be
there if it was up to their own "will".  We did hear in the news a while
back about some insubordination in the Israeli forces about some of the
attacks that have been ordered on targets in the Palestine area.  That's
bound to happen in extreme situations in any armed force.  Have there been
any stories of soldiers rebelling in the same way against serving to protect
the settlements?

<<Many settlements are protected by more troops than they have settlers.>>
    That I did not know, and I have to agree that it sounds as if a
substantial amount of military resources does in fact go into that activity.
I don't disagree that it would save a lot of money and be more conducive to
peace if the settlements could all be withdrawn, somehow or other.

    But, to get back to the issue of how the word "honesty" applies to this
situation.  Won't the settlers consider it "dishonest" if their military
protection were discontinued?  Or, put another way, wouldn't the government
have to admit it was dishonest in the past when it encouraged the settlers
to move into the settelements in the first place?  Don't the settlers have
the right to say "You promised us protection yesterday, and today you're
sentencing us to death." ?

<< to attribute (one's actions) to rational and creditable motives without
analysis of true and especially unconscious motives...>>
    I can't agree that that is full and accurate definition.  Is that saying
that if you follow a rational reasoning process and DO include analysis of
"true and especially unconscious motives", then you are not rationalizing?
It seems to me you are saying that all rationalization is invalid.  I would
describe rationalization as a process of justifying an attitude or an action
on a logical reasoning process based upon a set a premises.  Any
rationalization based fully on true premises is a valid rationalization.  If
one of the premises on which the rationalization is based is untrue, then it
can be an invalid rationalization.

<<I have enjoyed the Biblical studies back in High School and Junior High.>>
    As an aside, it's interesting that you had Biblical studies in public
school.  That is completely forbidden in public education in the US.  That
you get in Sunday school, or if you go to a Catholic school.

<<But I no longer adhere to the Ethics put forth by it.>>
    I will quarrel with you on that statement.  You have acknowledged that
there exists a "Universal code of ethics" (or an implied "constitution") by
which people should live.  I will argue that the original source of that
code was the Bible.  Or put it this way.  It existed in the Bible before it
was ever composed by a secular source.  In history, prior to the Age of
Enlightenment, it was the only source of such a code of ethics.  OK, I'll
admit that,.outside of the ethical rules to be found in the Bible which
happen to correspond with this "Universal code", there are a great many
rules that in modern time have become obselete and should be dispensed with.
But the "good" part of the Bible's ethical system was there before it
existed anywhere else.

<<1. Christianity had a large part in putting Europe into the dark ages and
weakening the Roman Empire.>>
    I think Gibbon makes the same argument.  Many other scholars disagree.

<<2. During the middle ages the Christian church believed that "spiritual
cleanness" was more important than "physical cleanness" and so the hygiene
traditions of the near easy and Rome were ignored. As a result, a lot of
diseases erupted in Europe, including the Black Plague (which Jews were not
affected from, because they kept a better hygiene).>>
    There's a point I hadn't heard before, that Jews suffered less from the
Black Plague.  This could be true, but I'm not so sure Christianity can
fairly be "blamed"  The Jewish tradition for hygiene came from the Bible,
and originated in an earlier time out of necessity.  Christianity may have
lost sight of that need and ceased to emphasize it, but it was more an error
of omission rather than commission.

<< 3. The Crusades were initiated by the Roman Catholic Church and are still
considered a good thing by them.>>
    That's a more common argument.  More below.

<<4. The Roman Catholic church was the greatest oppressor of women in
history.>>
    That can surely be quarreled with.  Women were oppressed everywhere, in
all societies.  Oppression of women today is most extreme under Islam.
Women have hardly had much freedom, for one example, in non-Christian Japan.

<<I can probably think of others.>>
    Besides the Crusades, the other popular target is the Spanish
Inquisition.  To which could be added witch-burning in both western Europe
and Colonial America.  That gives me an opening to throw out a quotation
from a book.  I've probably mentioned to you before, that from my
perspective here in the US, the most interesting movement to study is among
the Christian community, where a small number of advocates argue for
"rationalized Christianity", i. e. a version of Christianity from which is
purged much of the "true" mysticism, i. e. all the miracle tales told about
Jesus.  A very prominent advocate is one John Shelby Spong, an Episcopal
bishop.  He was a very early advocate of the ordination of women, and the
acceptance of homosexuals into the church.  Here is a passage from one of
his books.  I'll quote it verbatim, but I think it's something which you
find congenial if modifed by substitution of "The Jewish Orthodox
establishment" for all his references to Christendom.
    "... I think we Christians have tried to claim too much for our
revelation. ...... I think the Church has sought to accumulate power beyond
its deserving.  Today the underpinnings that support those claims are no
longer firm, and so the power is being rapidly withdrawn.  I have suggested
that Christianity as presently understood is being destroyed, not by new
possibilities, but by the fearful clinging to these dying traditional
approaches.  The institutional forms of Christianity are clearly in decline,
perhaps even dying.  Its conservative voices, both Catholic and Protestant,
are increasingly nonsensical, and it liberal voices are increasingly empty.
A premodern message simply cannot be heard by postmodern
ears........................  I do not believe in the infallibility of
popes, or the inerrancy of literal scriptures, or even the indefectibility
of sacred traditions.  History teaches us that  popes and churches can be
corrupt and evil and that traditions based on and derived from the sacred
scriptures can be used as weapons of oppression to enforce and justify human
prejudices."

    And that last sentence is an explanation, though not a justification,
for such episodes as the Crusades and the Inquisition.

To return to the "mysticism vs. reality" thread:"
<<You can distinguish the actual existence by verifying it against facts and
observations of the objective existence. Your mind can contort reality,  but
you should not explictly tried to do so.>>
    I assume you had written your last before you saw my "afterthought"
piece on this issue.  That language from you can be used to reinforce the
argument I made in my second message.  This reads as if it is meant to apply
to physical reality, i. e. realities as described in the physical sciences.
It cannot be applied unambiguously to the most fundamental and important
questions in the life sciences, in particular the behavioral sciences and
economics.  In these areas, it can be said that there is no such thing as
"reality".  There are only "opinions" about the consequences of policies,
and the operation of systems.  Cause-effect relationships are never
definitively provable.for the most controversial questions that face policy
makers.

    (I composed the above and sent it before checking to see if you'd
responded to my second message).

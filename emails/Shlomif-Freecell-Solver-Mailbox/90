Hi Shlomi,

    Here's a weird phenomenon.  I happened to run that new build I just sent
you in my other laptop, the one I use for communications. and of all things,
the solutions are different than they are in the development laptop.  What's
different is that some moves are missing in this laptop (the communications
one, which is slower by a factor of about two).  The moves that are missing
are moves to the foundation, which are now all supposed to be expressed
explicitly in the solution, as FCS delivers them.

    There has to be an explanation for this, and I can only think it's got
to do with the computer's relative speeds.  The solver runs in a thread, and
it just about has to be that some sort of asynchronous action is resetting
an indicator somewhere.  This is going to take some study.  I'll have to
figure out how to make it consistent regardless of timing.

    More later, I hope.

Best regards,  ---------------Adrian

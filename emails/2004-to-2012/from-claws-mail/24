Hi Shlomi,

    As far as that couple who claimed to have solved 11982, I am still 
extremely skeptical.  Showing a reporter doesn't mean much to me.  Can you 
contact the reporter?  I would like to know on what medium they demonstrated 
a solution to him.  I. e. did they play it on standard M/S Freecell?  Does 
the reporter know much about the game?

    They could be charlatans, or maybe they have unwittingly cheated in some 
manner.

<<Because neither Microsoft nor Ma'ariv (= the newspaper that reported it), 
want to spend the resources to make them meet.>>
    Oh, I see.  Have they been in contact with Jim Horne?  Has he heard 
about this?  Actually, I wonder if Jim Horne is really interested that much. 
I think people like you and I would be more interested.  It indicates a 
certain naivite that they want to meet Jim.  I seem to recall from a past 
contact that he regards it as something from his past, and not of any great 
consequence.  Or do you know different?

    On another subject.  My wife and I are buying another house, and will be 
moving in a few weeks.  The lawyer we are using (a woman) is Jewish, and she 
and her family are observant.  "Shanah Tovah!" on her, and she knew what 
that meant, but "Gmar Hatimah Tovah" was outside her knowledge of Hebrew.  I 
suppose I should look at that URL you gave me to see it that's where you 
explain it.  ----  Nope.  Nice message and thanks, but no language lesson. 
So what is the meaning of "Gmar........."?

Best regards, -----------------------Adrian

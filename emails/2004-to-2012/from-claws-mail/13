Hi Shlomi,

<<I am quite well known in some circles here in Israel (and to a lesser 
extent outside it). The problem is that I'm mainly involved with the Israeli 
online and offline (i.e: meetings, conferences, etc.) Open-Source 
community.>>
    Don't know whether this might be false optimism, but the situation you 
describe strikes me as something that "in time ought to lead to something". 
Of course, the question is "How much time?".  But it's not something to 
become complacent about.  I. e., I trust (or hope), that you are letting it 
be known around your circle of acquaintances that you'd have no objection if 
someone wanted to pay you a salary to do something on a regular basis.

<<Well, I'd rather not correct the text of Interview itself, because this 
smells like lack of journalistic integrity.>>
    You are quite correct.  Something like maybe as asterisk to a footnote 
saying something like "In later conversation with Mr. Ettlinger, upon 
refreshing his recollection, he believes the reference to the 4004 was a 
misstatement, and he should have said 8008.

<<Hmmm... well I lost track of what you were referring to here. (had to look 
back in my archives) That's the problem with your way of maintaining the
thread's integrity.>>
    Yes, as a matter of fact when I was writing that I was thinking maybe I 
should have quoted more of the past conversation to remind you.

<<I hardly watch T.V., or read newspapers, read mostly open-source-related 
news on the Web, and only hear of really major events through my friends' 
hearsay. I'm also out of touch with current Israeli 
show-biz............Maybe an Israeli cannot afford to do that....>>
    I see.  That is not unusual here in the US.  A good portion of the 
population is totally "apolitical" and "doesn't know what's going on." 
(Otherwise, to be sure, our presidential elections wouldn't so often produce 
such stupid results).  But, as you say, I can see that, it might be more 
risky for an Israeli to ignore what's happening.  Just, I suppose, from the 
standpoint of personal safety.  Did you hear that Netanyahu left the 
government in protest against the Gaza evacuation?

<<...a fellow engineer said that contemporary political events were like 
"White Noise". I.e: a lot of things are said or happen, but they amount to 
nothing.>>
    Very true, and also that attitude was very common in the engineering 
community in which I worked most of my life.  Nowadays I follow current 
events rather closely because I enjoy being a spectator to the game.  And 
I'm often amused how the pundits on TV are constantly exagerrating the 
importance of the tiny and virtually trivial events which occur.  One such 
brief cycle was back when they held that election in Iraq and there was a 
brief interval of euphoria, and all the pundits were saying "Maybe Bush was 
right all along".  They said that for about three weeks, then reality set in 
that virtually no progress is still being made.  And now just yesterday a 
poll came out showing public confidence in Bush's handling of Iraq at an 
all-time low, 38%.

<<There's a different between mental awareness and sentience. One may have 
mental awareness, but not sentience.>>
    Yes, it comes back to me now.  The great importance of language.  I 
suppose I should read Jaynes's book before commenting much further.  I'm 
already pre--prejudiced that my conclusion will be that he makes some 
interesting points but carries the analysis too far.  But it does sound that 
he will be worthwhile listening to.  Maybe I shouldn't do this, but based on 
this brief introduction, I might say that the way I would look at would be 
this.  I've made a big point that I consider religion originating primarly 
from curiosity, i. e., curiosity to explain natural phenomenon.  Well, I 
might further say that the way that relates to language is this:  Once 
language ability developed, humans naturally developed a desire to express 
explanations of natural phenomenon in language, and it was the need for that 
self-expression that was the main driving force behind the development of 
religion.

    This time I was able to finish this while all of the rest of the family 
was out of the house at the beach or somewhere.  But I have a few more brief 
E-mails I have to compose before I send this.

Best regards, ---------------------------Adrian

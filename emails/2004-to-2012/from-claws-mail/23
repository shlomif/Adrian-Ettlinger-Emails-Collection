Hi Shlomi,

<<If I pass these tests, then I graduate from the Technion...>>
    I have full confidence that you'll pass with flying colors.  Of course I
understand.

    I'm finding your comments very fascinating.  It illustrates how the
difference in cultures and especially language can influence the viewpoint
people take toward the (IMO) significantly subjective concept of "freedom".

<<Freedom from opression includes liberty of speech, liberty of choosing
your workplace, the freedom to own and maintain ownership, etc.>>
    It seems to me here, then, that we are getting into a circular
definition.  I. e., "oppression" is an antonym of "freedom".  Not exactly an
antonym, but it's definition is simply that it is any force which restricts
one's freedom.

<<Freedom from responsibilities includes not having to work, not having to
take care of your children, not having to study, and other responsibilities
like that.>>
    To my way of looking at it, that is a misuse of the word "freedom".  If
one is frustrated by having to work, take care of your family or studying, I
would say that being "freed" from those responsibilities lies outside of
definition we are seeking.   But the difference in our viewpoints
undoubtedly relates to this"
<<In Hebrew the word "Hufesh", which means "Freedom" also means a vacation.
So, it is a lack of work.>>
    From my viewpoint, that leads to confusion in dealing with the concept
of "freedom".  To be sure, when Americans as well as Israelis go on
vacation, they have a feeling of being "freed" from daily obligations.  Yes,
when one is on vacation, one faces a much wider range of choices of how to
spend one's time, so one can feel "more free".  But unless one is
vacationing alone, one may not be fully free, but may well need to
accommodate his daily schedule of activities to the wishes of others in
whose company he is vacationing.  E. g., these days when I go on vacation
with my wife, my four children and children-in-law, and five grandchildren,
I have almost no freedom whatsover to chose what I'm going to do throughout
each day.

    In short, I feel it is counterproductive to examining the nature of
"freedom" to bring into the discussion the "temporary" feeling of freedom
one may acquire when one goes through a short-term period of temporary
release from one's responsibilities.

<<From having to pay money -- ......No, I meant something like: "The first
two drinks are free."; "Get a free E-mail account.", "Free hosting for your
web service". Etc.>>
    Once again, that seems to me to be a digression from what we are really
interested in.  I. e., bringing in these two categories which in a sense
represent brief and temporary episodes or events in one's life where one is
temporarly "freed" from an obligation, we are digressing from main subject.

<<Actually, there's much more government waste in Israel than just the army.
A lot of money goes to:........>>
    Your list here has a very distinct parallel in the US, as many people
are highly critical of the efficiency or inefficiency of government
operations.  Here, with our much more complex political system, with many
autonomous levels of government, federal, state, county and municipality,
It's always in issue in almost every election that the people running the
government are not delivering adequate value for the money they are
spending.  I can't really judge the validity of your comments, but no doubt
there's a difference of opinion there.

<<Yes, it is. Women and those who support abortion can form militias who
will vow to protect and allow people to get abortions.>>
    The difficulty with that kind of interpretation is that, if applied to
the extreme end of its logic, you'd have a civil war raging between those on
the two sides of the issue.  It so happens that on the abortion issue, it's
the anti-abortion forces who are the ones who have been prone to violence,
and we've had a couple of doctors who perform abortions murdered as a
result.  The only truly civilized solution is for the government to
effectively enforce its laws.

    I'll leave the argumentation at this point for now, but I think in the
next phase of the discussion, we should concentrate once again on economic
freedom, the effects of laissez-faire, etc.

Best regards, ---------------------------Adrian

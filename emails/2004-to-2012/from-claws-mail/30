Hi Shlomi,

    I remember one keepalive a week or so ago, but not two.  You caught me
then in the middle of some unusual travel.  I was living for eleven days on
a railroad sleeping car, on a trip out to Ogden, Utah and back for a
railroad meeting.  I was doing Internet via a cell phone hookup, which was
rather awkward and time-consuming.  Sorry I didnt' get back to you sooner.

    I would llike to continue our dialogue, and should be able to sit down
to it sometime in the next couple of days.

    How are you doing?  What's going on with your job-looking activity?

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

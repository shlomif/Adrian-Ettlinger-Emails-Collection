Hi Shlomi,

    Don't know if you may have already replied to my earlier message, as for
some hopefully temporary reason, I was not able to recover E-mail just now.

    But I did have a chance to get my son's slant on the question of
voluntary social security, so thought I'd report this.

    His first reaction is that social security has proven to be the most
successful anti-poverty program ever devised, and has worked extremely well.
Before it was introduced, large numbers of elderly people lived in poverty,
and if they could not be supported by their children, became wards of the
state.  It is widely believed that if it were made voluntary even today,
many young people would foolishly opt out of it, and would meet financial
disaster late in their lives.  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that
rightwing politicians are constatntly raising storm signals and making
accusations that the system is not fundamentally sound and could go
bankrupt.  That is false alarmism, and while the system in the US may need
some adjustment, it can easily be fixed (the same does not necessarily apply
to the medical support system -- that's another problem, and of much more
serious import).  I'd add on my own that if it were made voluntary, there
would no doubt spring up a whole new industry of private financial services
that would offer alternatives to social security, and some of these would
inevitably be poorly (even if honestly) managed, and leave many people
destitute in old age.  Some could well be simply dishonest and steal the
people's money.  So a compulsory system is simply best and is the only way
to avoid these pitfalls.  In the US, this is tacitlly acknowledged even by
the most conservative of economists and politicians.  We sometimes have
advocacy to introduce some partially-voluntary variations to the system, but
no one ever proposes making it fully voluntary.

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

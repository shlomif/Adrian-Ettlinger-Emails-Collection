Hi Shlomi,

<<BTW, are you interested in me telling you about my recent happenings and
whereabouts? I'm interested to learn what's up with you as well.>>
    As a matter of fact, I am very interested and I'd intended to ask you
about that, but accidentally dispatched the last message before adding that
question.  So please fill me in.

Best regards, -----------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Thanks very much for the date of Chanukah.  That gives us time to find 
candles and get prepared.  I'm sure we have a Menorah around here somewhere.

    That's really some new education for me, about potato pancakes and 
sufganiyah.  Potato pancakes I am quite familiar with and have always 
enjoyed, but didn't know about their connection to Chanukah.  But Sufganiyah 
are totally new to me.  I've looked them up, and they certainly would be 
something I'd enjoy.  I doubt that I'd find any bakery around here that 
sells them; would probably have to go into Manhattan.  The signature Jewish 
bakery in Manhattan is a place on Houston St. called Yonah Schimmel's; 
haven't been there in years.  I think it's a good bet they'd have them.

    Problem is, and this you wouldn't have heard of yet -- back in July I 
had a heart attack -- quickly to qualify that, it was a "small" one, 
involving no pain, but it's had a definite effect on my well-being.  I'm not 
really suffering from it, except that I'm functioning at a much lower energy 
level since the episode.  Anyway, where the problem is that I'm on a rather 
strict no-fat diet, so I don't know if I'd be allowed anything deep-fat 
fried.  Researching on Internet, I found a recipe for baked sufganiyah, 
admittedly outside the real Chanukah tradition, but said to be a good 
substitute.

    The news from your part of the world was rather alarming for a while, 
but it seems things have calmed down now, at least for a time.  Hope it 
stays that way.

Best regards, -----------------Adrian

No, I first contacted you via Facebook, but then you have given me your

and I contacted you there.

Oh, I see.

See:

(short URL - http://xrl.us/bn39pc )

Namely, the first Chanukah Candle is on the evening of Saturday, 8 December
2012 (the evening between Fri and Sat), and it goes up to 8 candles (on 15
December). In Israel, we like to eat traditional Chanukah foods of
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potato_pancake and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sufganiyah , which are fried with oil, to
commemorate the pot of oil which was reportdely found in the second temple
untouched and was able to burn for the Menorah (the Candelabra in the 
temple),
for 8 days until more oil could be brought from the Galilee. I'm not sure
whether the diet of you and your wife will allow you to consume those, but
perhaps your children and/or grandchildren will enjoy them.

BTW, regarding your comment on Hollywood (and one of your grandchild's 
original
desire to become a filmmaker), you may relate to this Slashdot.org interview
with Wil Wheaton, who is a former Hollywood Child Actor, and now a voice
actor, a minor actor and a writer and a blogger:

http://slashdot.org/story/05/06/27/0926218/wil-wheaton-strikes-back

Namely he writes:

<QUOTE>
Child Actor Prodigy Success
by statusbar (314703)

It seems that most child actors end up growing up to be crack-heads,
drug-dealers, low class porn actors/actresses, and/or dead from bullets or
drugs.

How did you avoid all that mess? Was it easy or hard to avoid? Was there a
point in your life where you had to make a conscious choice? What would you 
say
to other child actors to help them avoid the pitfalls of early fame?

WW: I think not being on Diff'rent Strokes had a lot to do with it.

Thank you. Tip your waitress, and don't forget that you can play Keno right 
at
your table! Come back for the late show . . . it gets a little blue.

In all seriousness, I think most child actors end up as you described 
because
they believe all the hype they hear as kids. When I was a kid, it felt good 
to
hear from everyone that I was the next big thing, and I was always the 
golden
boy, and that I'd never lose the light in my eyes. Did I know it was all
bullshit? Right after Stand By Me came out, and I'd done some interviews and
dealt with some "Hollywood" people, I did.

Something kids and their parents (and all actors, really) need to remember 
is
that Hollywood is always looking for the next big thing; and that rarely 
means
the next amazing-but-undiscovered actor. In this business, a talentless 
whore
who gets fucked in grainy night vision is more valuable to the networks than 
a
talented actress who has spent years studying and honing her craft. That's 
the
reality of Hollywood in 2005, and if publicity and fame is more important to 
an
actor than the work, they're going find a void in themselves that can only 
be
filled by sweet, sweet heroin. Or late-night erotic thrillers featuring 
Shannon
Tweed and Lorenzo Lamas. See, fame comes from without, and the joy of
performing comes from within. Actors can always perform on stage (or start
blogs) if they can't get work in TV or movies. They probably won't get fame,
but they'll get the joy of performing.

I think that I avoided becoming a regular on Cinemax's late night 
boob-a-thons
because even when I was a kid, I quickly figured out the difference between 
the
kids (and their parents) who wanted to be Actors, and the ones who wanted to 
be Movie Stars. I never wanted to be a Movie Star, and the ones who did 
annoyed the hell out of me. They were the ones with the obnoxious stage 
parents, and we were the ones who just wanted to learn our lines and do good 
work. When we all grew up, guess who turned out okay, and guess who is 
selling his teeth on eBay? Okay, if I can drop a name for a second: I am 
lucky enough to have a signed copy of the book Sideways. When he signed it, 
Rex Pickett wrote,All that matters is the work. I think that's important and 
useful advice for anyone who gets into a business that mixes art and 
commerce. If the attention becomes more important than the work, you're 
boned.

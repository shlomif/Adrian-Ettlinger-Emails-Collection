Hi Shlomi,

<<Did you mix the numbers, or had a typo? Because you say that where you're 
at at the moment (Vineland, NJ) the price of gasoline is cheaper than where 
you
live. ($2.19 vs. $2.69).>>
    No, that is correct.  Why, might you have assumed it would be more 
expensive in Vineland.  The usual pattern in the US is that gasoline costs 
more in the affluent areas, and less in the less affluent areas.  In fact, 
my son told me he'd read an article once about how the major oil companies 
price their gas, and it's very much a "what the trade will bear" situation. 
I. e. gas is priced at whatever level the people living in a given region 
are willing and able to pay.

<<I was told that you don't find jobs from newspaper job ads ....... but 
rather mainly from contacts.>>
    I think that quite possibly holds true more for people after their 
careers are established.  I'm an exception myself, in that the main 
direction of my career in the broadcast industry with CBS started with 
answering a newspaper ad.  But every move from then on was from contacts. 
Your situation could well be different, however, in that you in a partial 
sense have already begun a "career" by your involvement with software 
groups.  Albeit, if you don't mind my saying it, a career that has yet to 
involve a "day job" paying a salary.

<<software companies are basically looking for people who will do what they 
tell them to do, who will be specialized in a certain area, and not think 
too much outside the box. Thus, programmers who have had extensive 
involvement in the open-source movement will not usually be good candidates 
for them. (And I am such a case). Thus, such developers should realize that 
once they are independant, they should remain independant.>>
    There's no doubt much validity in that.  However, there are certainly 
people who will be seeking to make a living in the open-source environment. 
I wonder if there'd be some way to hook up with other like-minded people.

<<I'm not that keen on starting my own company because............>>
    It certainly did not fit my temperament either to start my own company. 
Technically speaking I did have my own company when I operated for about 
twenty years as an independent consultant, but it was almost entirely a 
one-man company.  That was after I'd been working for CBS for 22 years, and 
I had become well enough known and established as to have a continuous 
series of good projects.  Then, my real lucky break came about because I'd 
had a long acquaintance with a man who "stock in trade" was doing "start 
ups", and he started up a company that was briefly very successful built 
around a product I had developed.  He also had the skill to sell out at the 
right time, which left me financially in a  reasonably secure (though hardly 
lavish) condition.

<<A better idea perhaps would be to become a 
consultant-slash-contractor....>>
    What you describe in this paragraph sounds to me quite promising, 
although in the "long run".  It will probably take patience while you build 
up a "following".

<<In any case, this reminds me - did you eventually buy Julian Jaynes' book 
about "The Origins of Concsiousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral 
Mind"?>>
    Glad you reminded me about that.  Unfortuately I'm now only about 
half-way through the last batch of books I bought.  I  really should create 
for myself a systematic way of keeping notes about books I want to read so 
I'll remember what to buy whenever I need a new batch.

<<Right now I've started to read Jared Diamond's "Guns, Germs and Steel".>>
    Yes, I read that some time ago, and found it very enlightening.

<<Among else, he claims that religion was a tool devised by the leadership 
to justify wars, a claim which doesn't hold water...>>
    I think you are talking about Diamonds "GG&S" here, and I might have a 
vague recollection of that, and also having a negative reaction.  But I 
think it cannot be valid to claim a "one-way street" in either direction 
here.  Take for example, from what I've just finished reading, the First 
Crusade.  On the one hand, from the outward appearance, the fundamental 
motivation was entirely religious, and there was no "leadership" here using 
religion as a tool.  The entire thing was fomented by Pope Urban II.  But it 
can be argued that part of his motivation came from his wanting to maintain 
his status as a "leader", as much as it came from a pure "religious" 
motivation.  Nevertheless, in the narrative of events, the course of its 
history depended very strongly at certain junctures on deep-held beliefs in 
the supernatural.  And in those cases, religion could be said to having been 
used as a tool.

    As you your previous message describing your very long working session, 
while much of the technical aspect was unfamiliar to me, I enjoyed it from 
the standpoint of how much it reminded me of how I often worked in my 
career, when the clock meant nothing and I could keep going for a long 
period of time.

Best regards, ------------------------Adrian

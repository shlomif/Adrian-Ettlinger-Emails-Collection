Hi Shlomi,

    I read the blog you referred me to.  I tried to put it into the 
clipboard to repeat it to quote from, but that somehow ddn't work.  But a 
couple of things I could comment upon.

    One thing I find refreshing, from the viewpoint of a resident in such a 
Christian country as this.  How one can feel so free to describe oneself as 
an "Atheist".  To be sure, here in the US there are atheists organizations 
and forums where atheists talk to each other.  But in "polite society", i. 
e. in any forum not dedicated to progressive religious discussion, one 
simply does not admit to being an atheist.  We do have a few public figures 
who make it rather clear in a subtle way that they are non-religiious, but 
they never will come right and say they are atheists.

    Another reference I find curious, and here's something I can ask you 
about.  Wondering if the "the shoe fits another foot" as far as Israel is 
concerned.  The girl who wrote that blog says something like "we are 
learning that Jews can be terrorists".   The question is:  How much detailed 
history do you learn about the final years of the British mandate?  It's 
well-known here to anyone who's read that history that there was much 
anti-British terrorism conducted by Jews in that period.  In fact, I once 
read an anecdote of an Israeli who, being interviewed for a job at some 
point in the 1948-1950 period, was asked what was his previous occupation, 
and he replied "terrorist".

    I should also mention that the "clearing out" of Gaza was very actively 
reported in our news media -- for several days it was the lead story in news 
telecasts.  I have to agree with most of what is said in the blog.  Except 
that one could also give some recognition to the fact that, no matter what 
the circumstances, and the background, no people anywhere like to be pushed 
out of homes where they've lived for many years.  It seemed to me, and was 
commented on here, that the Israeli armed forces did a very good job in 
handling the situation, as the blogist acknowledges.  From what I've heard 
just in the past couple of days, the removal for the token withdrawal from 
the West Bank went rather smoothly.

    Oh, yes, one common reaction here has been anger that the US is making a 
substantial financial contribution to this operation.  Something like 3 
billion dollars.  My answer is "Why not?".  We can afford it.  It's a 
pittance compared to what's being poured down the drain in Iraq.  Or I 
should say the Iraq disaster.

Best regards, --------------------------Adrian

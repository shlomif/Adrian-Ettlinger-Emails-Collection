Hi Shlomi,

    Interesting to read about the Bourekas.  It sounds as if the composition 
might be quite similar to the one offering of Yonah Schimmel's which we used 
to like to stop in there to buy some of, called a "Cheese Bagel".  Not 
shaped like a bagel at all, but pretzel-shaped, with a combination sweet and 
cheese flavor, and lightly-weighted dough.  Very tasty and also unique, in 
that I've never seen them anywhere else.

    You are no doubt correct about potato pancakes being a more recent 
"import" into Israeli cuisine.

    Re the situation in Gaza, the media here seemed to be treating it as if 
there was some doubt about "who started it".  But I thought the first I'd 
heard of it was Hamas lobbing missiles into Israel.   It's very good that 
the Iron Dome system is as effective as it is, although obviously not fully 
100% effective.

    I must say when this was at its height, my own hope was that Israel 
could mount an all-out ground attack that would not only take full political 
control of the Gaza strip but also, given that by now Israel must have 
fairly good intelligence as to where to find the Hamas leadership, 
effectively wipe out the Hamas organization.  But I suppose that really 
would not be as easy as it can be made to sound.  But with Hamas now so 
concentrated in Gaza, one would think that would make them more vulnerable 
to being just about wiped out in a quick, sudden campaign than they have 
been previously.

    It is being said that Iran is furnishing Hamas with most of its 
missiles.  But I've wondered why Israel cannot blockade such shipments.  Is 
it known by what route this traffic is able to follow?   Does it go in via 
the land connection to Egypt?

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

Nice, you can read more about its relation to Chanukah on the wikipedia. Of
course, from what I know, Potatoes were brought from the Americas, so potato
pancakes (or Latkes) should be a rather late tradition for Chanukah among 
Jews.

Ah, I see. Lately, there has been more variety in Sufganiyahs in Israel. 
Some
of them are now smaller than usual, some are filled with a different filling
and some are covered with various coverings. There's a small bakery/café in 
the
shopping centre close to my building, with really good baked goods of these
sorts. I also like to buy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6rek (which we
call Bourekas) there sometimes.

I see. You may have told me about it. A friend of mine who turned 50 a while
ago, also had a minor heart attack, so now he needs to go on a daily walk.

Ah, OK.

Yes, well, we had some alarms here in Tel Aviv, but no casualties. Most of 
the
missiles were destroyed by the Iron Dome system, but one of them hit a
building in Rishon-Lezion and caused some damage. Many Israelis are
frustrated that Israel accepted the ceasefire, and did not attack the Hamas 
in
the Gaza strip. Someone on IRC said that The Art of War (which I
admittedly have yet to read) says that “If your enemy is begging you for a
ceasefire, that is the time to hit him hard.” which makes sense in a way.
However, my mother noted, that there are various political constraints, like
our relationship with Egypt that need to be taken into account.

I talked with someone from India on IRC, who asked me what I think about the
fact that there were 3 Israeli casualties as opposed to over a 100 ones in
the Gaza strip. What he didn't understand is that the Hamas kept firing
missiles, and also used civilians as a human shield, and that Israel would
not have retaliated if they were peaceful (but they were not for a long
time). Part of the reason Israel had so few casualties is the fact that the
Hamas' competency at doing them is not too good. However, the many alarms 
are
still disruptive to the lives of Israelis in the territories close to the
strip (including recently Tel Aviv, where I live), and Israel should be 
allowed
to retaliate against that.

The Hamas had a history of breaking the ceasefires, so we'll see how long 
this
one will last. My mother also told me that in the Gaza strip, every three 
men
form an organisation, so it was hard to maintain order, which reminded me of
this Monty Python skit:

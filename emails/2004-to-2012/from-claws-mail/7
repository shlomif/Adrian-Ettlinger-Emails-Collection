Hi Shlomi,

    I've now thought of a couple of themes to talk about.  The second one
deals with economics, and that will follow.  The first was on religion, and
what's below is something I started to draft on Monday, then got
sidetracked.  I'll finish it up now and follow later with the economics
"lecture".

    Glad you "finally" got back to me.  It's going to take some time for me
to compose an appropriately thought-out substantive reply to all the points.
But I just thought I'd pass along to you a little bit of a story of what
I've been up to intellectually in the past ten days, which have involved
quite a bit of exposure to discussion about religion.  Reflecting on it, I
might or might not have been more persuaded to your viewpoint by all this.

    My wife and I took a trip to Portland, Oregon and then to Salt Lake
City, Utah.  In Portland, we visited her brother, whose health is declining.
Both he and his wife are essentially atheists, and we had some engaging
conversation about the hypocrisies in religion.  But the real exposure to
religion talk came in Salt Lake City.  As you are probably aware, that is
the center of the Mormon religion, officially the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter Day Saints.  (If I have that word order correctly).  Now then, if you
observe how Mormon culture operates, you can find some very good arguments
for the beneficial effects of religion.  Within the Mormon community, there
is much less crime, and much more common human decency in operation that one
finds in American society in general.  I have long had an admiration for
these aspects, i. e., LDS (as it's usually referred to when you're there)
seems to really "work".  My wife had a brother who married a Mormon and
converted, and became a stalart supporter.  We visited one of his daughters,
and I spent two days in their household.  I've been there before and always
enjoyed the visits, as she and her husband both are very pleasant and
hospitable, and have a sense of humor, and don't make any attempt to
persuade us to their beliefs.  Naturally, out of my interest, I asked many
questions.  Some of the answers surprised me, because previously when I've
questioned Mormon friends (I have others), they've given me an impression of
fairly flexible on questions of theology -- as if they don't really take it
all that seriously, and are Mormons mainly because of the attractions of the
culture.  But then I got exposed to how my niece's husband answered
theological questions, and my reaction was "My God (excuse that!), these
people really are swallowing a lot of fairy tales!  It sounded like this
guy, who otherwise seems to be a very intelligent man, actually believes
that a man by the name of Joseph Smith in the 1830's and 1840's was given a
set of gold plates on which was inscribed a story about Jesus coming (after
the supposed "resurrection") to North America and preaching to all the
inhabitants of the continent.  Plus a lot of other Christian stuff, the holy
trinity, etc.  So I was somewhat taken aback by all that.

    Then I had another interesting encounter.  At the genealogy convention I
attended, my partner, who knows many people in that field for much longer
than I, happened to mention that a man who he knows well and I know
slightly, and who we'd both been assuming for a long time was a Mormon, was
in fact not, and instead was a Seventh Day Adventist.  These are people who
are fully Christian in most respects, but believe the Sabbath should be
observed on Saturday.  I learned some things I hadn't realized before.  That
the reason Christians observe the Sabbath on Sunday is that's the day the
supposed resurrection of Jesus occurred.  So now I finally understand why
the Jews stick to Saturday.  I questioned this Adventist as to the rationale
of their belief.  It is that they interpret the reason for the shift to
Sunday as motivated primarily for another reason of expediency, with the
resurrection story only being an excuse.  They think this all happened
during the age of Constantine when (as was previously aware) the Christian
religion as it is known today was really "invented".  And the shift was made
because many pagans observed a Sabbath on Sunday, and they just want to
attract more converts by catering to their preference for the day of the
Sabbath.

    Lastly, I have a confession.  This illustrates how truly secular I am in
most respects.  I totallly forgot about Passover.  Reflecting, I'm aware
that it's about the same time as Easter (you can't avoid hearing about that
in this country), but it never occurred to me this year that the time had
come to buy some matzohs.  So thanks for reminding me, although I guess it's
now too late.

Best regards, -------------------------Adrian

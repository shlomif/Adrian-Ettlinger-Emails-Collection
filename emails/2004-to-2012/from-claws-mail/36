Hi Shlomi,

    I wasn't expecting such a quick reply to my last message, but since you
did (because you "felt like it", which is fine, and the best time), I'll
continue this dialogue instead of moving over to economics.

<<I kept Passover Kashruth (i.e: did not eat Hametz)>>
    Two terms there with which I am not familiar.  "Kashruth" sounds like
close to the equivalent of "Kosher" and "Hametz" sounds like either the
equivalent of prohibited meats, or leavened bread, which as I recall is the
only food explicitly prohibited during Passover.

<<eat Pig's Meat>>
    I suppose I keep a very watered-down version of that prohibition myself,
in that I never eat pork itself, although I do eat bacon and shellfish.

<<I did eat bread crumbs as part of Shnitzels my mom prepared>>
    Did that mean your mom did not observe the dietary prohibitions at all?

<<I got a 56% or 57% or 58% percent final grade in Statistics>>
    Congratulations.  The lowness of the passing scores surprises me, and
must mean the exams are much tougher that what we usually have hear.  Don't
think I ever heard any percentage less than 70 required as a passing grade
in any level of US education.

<<I believe that this makes me eligible from graduating from the Technion,
but have to find out what the exact procedure is. I may have to wait until
my grades enter the grades' tracking system (at the moment, none of them
did). And I'll try to find out what the procedure is.>>
    That sounds strange also.  The expectation here would be that you would
automatically be notified that you'd graduated

    I'm reminded of my engineering education.  I didn't have the personal
application problems you did, and got reasonably good grades, but had become
quite bored with the process, and was glad it was over.  You'll be in a
whole new world once you go out to find a real job to do.

<<I still find you made a complete logical error when claiming that the
social security systems in many democracies nowadays are voluntary. A
voluntary action is such that is done out of one's own free will, without
being forced to do so. At the moment, we are _forced_ to pay for social
security. If not, we will go to jail. Some people may not like this, and
would rather not pay, while not receiving social security in return. They
cannot.>>
    I'll have to ask my son to comment on that -- he just happens to be
visiting here overnight right now.  I'd agree that the use of the word
"voluntary" should perhaps be qualified here.  It's a voluntary decision of
the society not to make it voluntary on the part of the individual.  I
believe when it was first started, it was felt that it had to made
involuntary for the individual, or else so many people would be distrustful
of it that not enough would join.  Rightwingers here sometimes advocate
converting the system to be individually voluntary.  Perhaps at this time
that would be practical, because such a large portion of the population has
confidence in the system that not many would opt out.  But still, many of
those who would opt out would probably not have the wisdom or knowledge to
invest wisely, and woud become welfare problems in their advanced years.
This is probably the reason why the right wing does not pursue this idea
seriously.  Something approaching that idea had now been passed we respect
to government support of medical care for seniors, and the left is
predicting it might become a disaster.

<<If you are qualified for service, do not lie to get out of it, and simply
stress that you refuse to serve in the army - you'll go to jail.>>
    But "conscientious objection" is still honored?  Do you mean that one
must prove membership in a religious sect, i. e. only non-atheists can avoid
service?

    I might get a chance later today to right again, this time on economics.

Best regards, ----------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Just a brief reply, more later.

    I misspoke when I said Jaynes's defintion of consciousness was too
broad, I really meant too narrow.  Here's how the first review starts out::
============================
Timothy Dougal .....from Joliet, IL United States It's hard to describe
exactly what this book did to me. Suffice it to say that my views on
history, religion, language and consciousness seem to be permanently
altered, and my reading and thinking have broadened as a result. Jaynes
defines conscousness too narrowly for some philosophers and psychologists,
who seem to want it to include all of perception, but for me, his focus on
interior dialogue, conceptual space, the notion of self, the ability to
narratize and project this self into theoretical situations, is right on
target.
============================
    I do feel, very strongly, that the most accepted definition of
"consciousness" does in fact include "all of perception".  Otherwise we
would have to say that all animals are always unconscious.  But, of course,
we can still accept and derive some understanding from Jaynes's ideas if we
keep in mind his unusual definition.

Best regards, -------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I reviewed what had happened.  This grew out of my discussion with Kai 
Henschel, who was trying to compile from the source set we had posted on 
your website.  There actually were three problems.  I'd omitted two 
libraries, and also had an obselete copy of one file.  It does not appear 
that I ever followed through and assembled a complete set of files.  The 
quickest expedient would be if I leaned on you to do that.  So I'm 
forwarding to you copies of the three messages I'd sent to Kai with the 
three attachments of the two missing and one updated file.  Let me know if 
this is OK with you.

    There is an interesting epilogue to the story.  I asked Kai about his 
background.  It turns out he is a young German now living in the US.  I 
starting to engage him in conversation about Germany, and about some of my 
travels there.  I mentioned to him that my first exposure to Germany was a 
visit to Dusseldorf in 1956, at which time the downtown area was still 
largely unrepaired from the bomb damage of the war, with most of the 
buildings bombed out hulks.  I'm wondering if this somehow offended or upset 
him, because I never heard from him again.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<<You probably meant Jewish cuisine>>
    I stand corrected.  I don't suppose Israel has had a chance to develop a 
cuisine of its own as yet, although I'd think there might have been some 
development.

<<Well, I recall something about Israel assassinating a prominent Hamas 
leader, and the Hamas retaliated, but really the Hamas has been breaking 
many ceasefires for a long time.>>
    That's right, I do recall hearing that story on the news before the 
Hamas rockets started appearing in the news.  This reminds me of a lecture I 
heard from someone from Israel many, many years ago, I think probably when 
Israel was very young.  He described how Arabs then on all sides were 
constantly committing various acts of violence along the borders, most too 
small to get much press attention, and how difficult it was then to deal 
with the situation.

<<I'm still looking for a job if you can give me some leads. I have a few 
leeds and some E-mails and job interviews, but nothing final yet.>>
    Sorry to hear that.   I wish I had some connections that could be 
helpful, but I just don't.    Hope something turns up for you soon.

    Oh, BTW, I now remember why our previous dialog came to a halt, and it 
was my fault.  I had asked you for some technical help with Facebook, 
because I wanted to sever my connection to someone on whose list I was.  You 
gave me directions, but for some reason I was never able to find the page 
you were trying to direct me to.  However, by now I really don't feel the 
need to pursue this.  The fellow had posted something which was so 
diametrically opposed to my political views that I didn't want to be exposed 
to any more of his idiocy.  He has not since then done any more such 
posting, and, besides, I'm sure the way the recent election came out, he's 
not very likely to shoot off his mouth any more.  And the election made me 
much more happy than it made him, I'm positive.  But anyway, I was 
postponing replying to you while I was struggling with the problem, and I 
think that might have been just about the time I had the heart problem, 
which distracted me from pursuing it any further.

Best regards, -------------------------Adrian

Ah, interesting. I may have liked something similar.

You probably meant Jewish cuisine, as the modern State of Israel dates to 
well
after the Americas were discovered.

Well, I recall something about Israel assassinating a prominent Hamas 
leader,
and the Hamas retaliated, but really the Hamas has been breaking many
ceasefires for a long time.

Naturally, I don't expect the Iron Dome system (or most anything in the
physical world) to be 100% effective. See:

I think it goes through the Egyptian (through Sinai) land connection. I 
think
the egyptian authorities don't patrol Sinai too closely (in part due to the
peace agreement with Israel that declared Sinai a demilitariased zone).

I'm still looking for a job if you can give me some leads. I have a few 
leeds
and some E-mails and job interviews, but nothing final yet.

I'm glad to hear from you again.

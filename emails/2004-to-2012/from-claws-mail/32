Hi Shlomi,

    I must apologize that I have not responded to a number of "keepalives"
from you.  I suppose it's partly because I couldn't really think of anything
new or original enough to say, relative to the main stream of our previous
dialogue.

    I'm moved to write now for a reason.  I just happened to catch on TV a
rerun of the 1946 movie "The Fountainhead", as you know, by Ayn Rand.  It
seemed to me in watching it that it very likely was a accurate transcription
of the novel itself, although I was somewhat suspicious whether a "Hollywood
ending" had been tacked on.  But then, doing some research, I find that Ayn
Rand herself had written the screenplay and had insisted on reusing much of
the original dialogue from the novel.  But what I'd found did not explicitly
say whether the ending was faithful to the novel.

    I believe the review that I saw was written many years ago, perhaps not
long after the release of the movie.  A question now on my mind is:  What is
reallly the proper place to put Ayn Rand-style libertarianism on the
political scale?  The reviewer (Pauline Kael, a very prolific movie-reviewer
for the New Yorker Magazine) did refer to the movie as expressing a
"right-wing" philosophy.  I think it is fair to say that Ayn Rand's
philosophy, and her arguments, are intended to be "anti-left wing".  Now
then, some time ago, I mentioned Ayn Rand to my wife, and she said she's
once read something by her, and when I said I thought Rand was a "Fascist",
she said she didn't get that impression at all.  After seeing a good part of
the movie, I'd have to agree.  Being "anit-collectivist", I would now say,
is not necessarily bieng either right wing or left wing.  I would say the
Libertarian philosophy is off on a different axis.  Both Communism and
Fascism are, after all, different flavors of collectivism.

    I wonder if you have read "The Foutainhead" or seen the movie.  I'll
tell you now what my quarrel is with the language I heard in the movie, and
for the movie itself.

    They say movies require "a suspension of disbelief".  Well, for one
thing, the entire theme of the movie makes such a suspension impossible for
me.  I consider the human characters to be all gross caricatures.  There
never were, and never could be, people like that.  But further, as to the
"philosophy" expounded, it also is a caricature, or, let's say, it
caricatures collectivism.  A realistic view of the political and social
systesm of today's industrial free-market economic entities is that they
must of necessity operate to a substantial extent on certain collectivist
principles.  Rand talks as if any application of collectivist principles
must totally stifle individualism.  A factual account of the operation of
today's free-market systems would recognize that within the bounds of
whatever collectivist restraints may be imposed on the individual, there
remains plenty of room for individual expression and action.  Rand talks
about collectivism as if it totally stifles individuality, which is nothing
but a gross caricature.

    Found some more interesting material on Rand from web browsing, which
I'll put into a separate message.

Best regards, ---------------------------Adrian

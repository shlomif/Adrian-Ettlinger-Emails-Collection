Hi Shlomi,

    I'll make an attempt to use "middle-posting" or whatever the term is for 
"non-top-posting".  But it seems to me there's a problem here,  What I have 
from you is your message interspersed with my message, so it seems to me I 
have to do a lot of deleting to avoid sending back to you all the text from 
my previous message.  Or should I just let it go that way.  Well, I'll try 
it without editing.

OK, I was able to read that file, i. e., it was formatted to be readable for 
me.  But now then, is this the same thing you sent earlier, i. e., an E-mail 
you said you were planning to send (but I assume as of then had not sent), 
or is this that message plus copies of additional conversation?

Maybe there are societal differences between the US and Israel, but your 
long description of your psychological situation, I think, in an American 
group would not likely be reacted to with much sympathy.  I'd expect most 
people would simply not have the patience (combined with the compassion) to 
try to deal with it.  In fact, as regards your banning, I might say that 
"lack of patience" was likely the best explanation for why someone decided 
to ban you.   It might have been better to phrase this more briefly, 
something like "I know I have a personality trait that I sometimes express 
myself in a manner that others find offensive, and I have been working on 
myself to try to correct that.  I can only appeal to you to please be more 
patient with me."

As said above, whoever it was just didn't have the patience to deal with the 
situation creatively.

Skipping the stuff we already covered.  But it occurred to me, I wonder if 
what I said shortly after we moved to the new residence was not about myself 
feeling disoriented, but about our cat.  He was quite disoriented at first, 
but after a few months became acclimated and now really enjoys his new home.

That sounds just like Einstein!!! The book I read did not have that

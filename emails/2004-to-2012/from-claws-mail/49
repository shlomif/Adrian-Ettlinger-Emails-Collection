Hi Shlomi,

    Received the message.  As usual, you provide so much food for thought
that I really have to get myself in the mood to sit down and concentrate on
it.  I'd especially like to engage in some discussion of the definition of
"Freedom".  Give me a few days.

Best regards, -----------------------Adrian

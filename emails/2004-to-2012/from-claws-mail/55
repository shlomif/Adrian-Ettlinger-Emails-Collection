Hi Shlomi,

    Just a quick response.  I think you're my only correspondent who does 
not use "top-posting".  I can see the advantages of "in-the-middle" posting, 
so I'll try to use it in the future.  ------------------Adrian  (This one is 
still top-posted).

Hi Adrian!

Thanks for the prompt response, and sorry for the lateness of mine.

I see.

Yes, indeed. Israel is too dense to afford such an extravagance in "country
clubs" so I suppose "country club" is an Israeli hyperbole-of-sorts for
an "health club".

Top-posting is what you're doing now - replying to the entire email at one 
big
block at the top. What I am doing is quoting what you're saying and then
replying to each section after it, so we both don't lose context.

From what I noticed top-posters often fail to address many of my most
important points, or to incporate many non-sequitors or otherwise
topic-offshoots into what they say. I'm not saying this is the case for you,
but it's still a good idea not to top-post.

Yes, it is a mailing list.

Right.

Hi Shlomi,

    I should have responded to your earlier keepalive.  Part of the problem
was not being able to decide just where to pick up the conversation.

    Maybe the thread that I most thought we should explore further is that
of altruism.  I noticed an article in the current Scientific American which
reminded me of some of our conversation.  It dealt with behavior among
animals of a type normally ascribed only to humans.  Not exactly altruism,
but some aspects are close to it.   I haven't read it yet, but the title was
"How Animals do Business"  subtitle "The Evolutionary Roots of Economic
Behavior".  A brief synopsis: "Humans and other animals share a heritage of
economic tendencies, including cooperation, repayment of favors and
resentment of unfair pay."

    Sounds like there could be some food for thought for our discussion in
there.  I'll read it and let you know what I get out of it.

Best regards, ----------------------------Adrian

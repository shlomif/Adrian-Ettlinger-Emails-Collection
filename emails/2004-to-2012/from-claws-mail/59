Hi Shlomi,

    I'm not sure why we stopped talking.  But if you contacted me only via 
Facebook, that could be an explanation.  Every time I try to use it, 
something seems to crash.

    We had a good Thanksgiving.  Yes, I certainly would know that Christmas 
is not celebrated in Israel.  Lately, it's become "controversial" in the US, 
because those here who believe in separation of church and state do not like 
to see celebrations of Christmas appear on government property, and when 
they protest, some of our right-wing evangelistic crazy fanatics start 
yelling that there is a "War on Christmas".

    Now, if you can tell me on time what is the schedule for Chanukah, maybe 
I'll be able to burn candles this year for a change.  But whatever, hope you 
have a very pleasant Chanukah season.

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

Hi Adrian,

hope you had a Happy Thanksgiving. Hanukkah is upcoming as well, and 
somewhat
later Christmas (which we in Israel do not commemorate).

In any case, I hope everything is OK. Why have you not replied to my
earlier message (quoted below). It's possible that you did and it was
considered spam by my spam filter (though it seems unlikely). I'll
check.

Regards,

Shlomi Fish

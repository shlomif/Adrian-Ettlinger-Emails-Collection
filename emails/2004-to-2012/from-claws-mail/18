Hi Shlomi,

    This time I'm replying "abruptly".

<<<< Of course, around here, as you can imagine, it's very difficult for any 
public figure to say exactly what he thinks without being accused of being a 
"traitor", and not supporting "our heroic troops".>>
<<Interesting. That borders on censorship. Do media people say those things 
or only right-wing leaders? (such as Republicans, religious figures, etc.)>>
    Let's see, how to describe it.  There really isn't any censorship, 
except from the motivation media people are subject to not to allow 
themselves to become unpopular by saying things that too many people will 
strongly dislike.  This makes it very difficult to talk about the war in a 
negative way without appearing to be critical of the troops.  However, back 
when the big story was breaking about the treatment of Islamic prisones at 
Abu Ghraib prison and at Guantamino Bay, there certainly was sharp criticism 
aimed at the troops directly involved.  On the other hand, the media, IMO, 
devotes far too much air time to "hero worship" coverage, and also to 
exploitation of the families who are bereaved over losses of sons killed in 
Iraq.

    To give my own personal opinion, I feel that the US military has done an 
excellent job with respect to its mission in a narrow technical sense, i. 
e., they very quickly gained a "nominal" level of control over the country. 
I. e., they totally eliminated the Iraqi armed forces as an organized 
military entity.  On the other hand, what they did not anticipate, and IMO 
were very stupid about, was the potential for the situation to break down 
into the guerilla warfare situation that has since evolved.  Another 
issue -- we still hear rhetoric like "The Iraqi people really crave 
freedom", which is utterly irrational and encourages clinging to very false 
hopes.  One commentator I heard said "This is basically a tribal society, 
and they are more interested in killing each other than they are in building 
democracy".  Another bit of background that is mentioned now and then.  The 
US State Department (while under Colin Powell) was the place where there was 
some level of appreciation for such factors, and State produced a very long 
report on "The Future of Iraq" which evidently contained much intelligent 
analysis.  Stories are repeated about how this report was totally ignored in 
the Defense Dept., and even that Defense personnel were ordered not to read 
it.  Even now, there is this delusion you hear continually from the 
rightwingers about how important this constitution is, and it will fix 
everything.  The unfortunate aspect of the situation is that it will take a 
few years after the constitution is adopted before it will have to be 
recognized that it isn't working as expected.

<<One should note that there are some cultural differences between the Iraqi 
Shi'ite and the Persian ones: the former speak Arabic, while the latter 
speak Farsi. It also involves their origin as primarily Semitic/Arab people 
vs. primarily Indo European people.>>
    Yes, we hear that point made, and also references to the history going 
back to ancient times, where the boundary between present-day Iraq and 
present-day Iran has so long been a boundary between two distinct 
civilizations with a profound and enduring hatred for each other.  But I 
think the present-day situation is much modified by the fact that the Shiite 
area of Iraq was for so long discriminated against by the Sunni-dominated 
central government, that the Iraqi Shiites are virtually being driven into 
the arms of the Iranians.

    As an aside, another interesting coincidence here.  My wife and I, for 
perhaps half to one-third of our evenings, are watching old and classic 
movies from a rental service, and last night we happened to watch 
"Intolerance" by D. W. Griffith (1916), considered by some critics the best 
silent film ever made.  A big part of the film is a lavish recreation of 
ancient Babylon, and portrayal of its conquest by Cyrus, emperor of Persia.

<<A girl I know wrote a summary of the disengagement from the Gaza strip 
from her Point of View in her blog:>>
    I'm going to look at that after I finish this.  I am curious as to how 
Israelis are looking at this.  Some people here I've heard express what I 
think is a very narrow and idiotic viewpoint like "Why did Sharon ever do 
this?  It won't solve any problems."  My response is of course it won't, but 
it's an essential step in what eventually is going to have to be a very, 
very long process.  Ultimately the West Bank has to be rationalized as well, 
and that will be much tougher.  But they have to start somewhere.

    On to Einstein:
<<Did he went from one institution to the other, and each one had its own 
reasons for not hiring him? Or was it because of some reputation he got?>>
    Well, as you're finding, organizations that don't hire you very seldom 
give a reason.  Evidently he applied to many schools for teaching jobs and 
was always turned down.  Purely from speculation, it seems quite possible 
that he had a personality at that young age that worked against him.  One 
gets the impression that there might have been quite a bit of arrogance in 
his manner at that stage of his life.

<<I don't suppose you were still at your beach vacation when writing this 
E-mail? (it's been over two weeks since 29/7).>>
    Oh, yes, this is the third weekend we've been home (the second full 
weekend; we got home two weeks ago today, early in the afternoon).

<<I now have a contracting (or perhaps outsourcing) opportunity presented to 
me by a fellow Perl Monger, who has his own company that does such 
consulting as well as open-source training. It is in Perl and for a 
web/Internet-related project, which I have quite a lot of know-how in.  If I 
accept it, which so far looks like what I do>>
    That's exactlly the direction I've felt you should go.  Sounds parallel 
to what I did.  Have no idea how prevalent such opportunities are in Israel, 
but it's a nice way to earn a living if the jobs keep coming.

    Well, I've run out of talk, finally.

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

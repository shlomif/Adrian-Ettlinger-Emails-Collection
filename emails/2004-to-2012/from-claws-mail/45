Hi Shlomi,

    I'll start by going back to your message of 11/2.  Late last month my 
wife and I moved to a new house (after living in the previous one for 42 
years), so I've been somewhat disoriented by settling in (we still have a 
lot of boxes to unpack), which is the main reason why I hadn't replied re 
Jaynes.  Also, your answering comments to my critique were rather delayed 
after I'd finished reading the book, so I had to re-collect my thoughts.

<<This review does not explain why what Jaynes say is incorrect.>>
    I think the main thing these reviewers and I have a problem with in 
Jaynes is his use of the word "unconscious".  Actually, after I had finished 
reading the book, I somewhat tempered my criticism of Jaynes.  I felt that I 
had learned something from him.  But one way I'd put it is that I think he 
tells us more about the historical development of language, and of religion, 
than he does about the development of human consciousness.

<<Well, if you ask me I don't see why people who were unconcious as Jaynes 
describes were incapable of properly functioning. They were still able to 
think, reason, talk, etc. And their left hemisphere was enough to do that.>>
    Well, I might say that if one can think, reason and talk, one is 
conscious.  Let me put it this way.  In ancient times when Jaynes calls 
humans "unconscious", just to take one example, the pyramids were built. 
Now then, a project like the pyramids required organization, division of 
labor, and a heirarchical management structure.  What I have a hard time 
visualizing is this:  If we would observe and listen to the conversations 
and the interpersonal relations that had to be in effect, what would they 
sound like?  If everyone was unconscious, what did it sound like and look 
like when they interacted with each other?

    Nevertheless, I did feel that I now have a more satisfactory grasp of 
the early stages of the development of language, and the development of 
religious attitudes, than I had before, from reading Jaynes.  But I would 
describe the way people thought and acted much differently, and with less 
extremity, than the way Jaynes describes it.  I do feel that Jaynes is 
overinfatuated with Schizophrenia, from his career in studying that mental 
disease.

=========================================

    Now, with regard to your follow-up.  I enjoyed reading your letter of 
resignation.  If I were to react in a pedestrian conventional manner, I 
might be saying things to you like "Now, then, people often have to earn a 
living doing work they find tedious."  But if you have no immediate pressing 
economic need to earn a living, I really don't see anything wrong with your 
continuing to look around to find work that you'll find intellectually 
stimulating.

    Also, I had to be somewhat amused by how you express the kind of 
projects you'd like to work on, involving the interaction of hardware and 
software.  It reminds me so much of my career, and I had to think how much 
you would have enjoyed working on the kind of projects which were almost the 
entire content of my working career.  Of course, in my case, I started out 
with the hardware, and software was for me a tool to control hardware which 
I otherwise might have had to control by hardware means.  I'd imagine the 
perspective would be different for someone who first learns software and 
then finds applications which require applyiing the software knowledge to 
control hardware.

Best regards, -------------------------Adrian

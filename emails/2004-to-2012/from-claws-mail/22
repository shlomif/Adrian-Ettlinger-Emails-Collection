Hi Shlomi,

<<But please at least keep me updated on your news.....>>
    Well, let's see.  I'm still kicking.  Last two trips were in May to 
Indianapolis for a railroad history meeting, and then in June to Nashville 
for a genealogy meeting.  Leaving tomorrow for our annual beach vacation 
with the extended family (son and daughter with spouse-in-laws and five 
grandkids), which this year we're making for two weeks.  My wife and I like 
to go down to southern New Jersey the night before because traffic from New 
York to the Jersey beaches is always horrific on Saturdays.  We're doing 
what we did last year, and instead of staying near the shore (like around 
Atlantic City) where hotel rates are annoyingly high, we're going to stay in 
Vineland, NJ, which is in the interior of the state, and is in an 
agricultural area that "no one ever travels through".  It's interesting 
because it's a genuine working community, and not under any influence from 
the tourist industry.  Not very prosperous, but not destitute either.

<<....and possibly comment on mine.....>>
    Sorry I hadn't done that, but my recollection is that your news was 
tentative, and more news might follow.  Anything going on on the job front 
since your last report?

<<Well, as I recall some compilers prepend an underscore.....>>
    Hey, that's a new word for my vocabulary .... prepend ....   You hit the 
nail on the head.  That was my problem.  I identified the problem and it was 
that I had an obselete version of that fc_pro_iface.c (right name?) in the 
file set.

    Even though very few people have asked about the software, and this was 
the first person to try to compile it, I would like to upgrade what we have 
posted so that it "works".   If I prepare another copy of the source, can 
you take care of replacing the defective ones (or one) that is now posted on 
the web?

    I'm glad to see that there is some hope now that your part of the world 
might be becoming more peaceful.

Best regards, ---------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Those are interesting articles about cuisine in Israel.  I wasn't aware 
that hummus is a staple in the area.  We have hummus fairly often as an 
entertainment item, to use as a dip on on the appetizer tray.

    I am finally set to start the Chanukah candles this evening (or 
afternoon).  We've had an interesting indication that perhaps interest in 
Jewish customs is declining here.  In the past we've always found the 
candles for sale in various local stores, but this year, it appears that in 
our particular community, no one stocks them any more.  There is not a very 
large Jewish community around here, although we do have one Reformed temple 
not very far away.  We thought we'd go ask there.  But then, yesterday, my 
wife and I both had to travel about a one hour drive to our dentist (we 
still patronize the fellow we had at our old location), and that's much 
closer to New York City, and an area with a heavier concentration of Jewish 
population.  We stopped at a shopping center and first tried a large chain 
drug store, but no luck.  Then, and we had to nod our heads knowingly, 
wouldn't you know, a small convenience shop operated by Koreans had them. 
Around here most of the small scale grocery and convenience stores are owned 
and operated by Korean, and mostly they do a very good job.

    I had to research to find the approved way to light the candles.  And 
learned that the most prominent candle is called the "shamash".  Our menorah 
has the shamash at on end.  I didn't recall whether there is a prescribed 
order in which to use the other positions, but find that, as make most 
sense, one should start from the opposite end, which should be on the right. 
So now all that I'll be able to do correctly.  I also found what prayer to 
say, in both Hebrew and English, but since we never have done that part, 
being too secular in outlook, I don't think I'll start now.

    Sorry to hear about your job situation.  Guess about all you can do is 
to keep trying.  I'll be hoping for you.

Best regards, -----------------------Adrian

actually, it did, though a lot of it is borrowed from various sources. See 
for
example http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_cuisine .

There's also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hummus#Controversy .

Yes.

Thanks! I'm still looking but often I'm considered underqualified or
overqualified or my C.V. just gets lost in confusion and they even don't
acknowledge that they have received it. I recall receiving some rejections
letters in the (physical) mail and now I often don't even get "We got your 
C.V.
and we'll look at it" E-mails. It's possible that companies are getting too
many CVs now, but often it happens even when they publish a wanted ad on
various open-source forums.

Ah, OK. I normally don't visit my Facebook page (too much junk
information (and that's often an overstatement) going on there), but perhaps 
I
should visit it once a day to learn about my friends upcoming birthdays. I 
can
set up a daily alarm for it.

Hi Shlomi,

    And a Happy New Year to you!

<<....it was reported that an Israeli couple solved board #11982....>>
    I don't believe it.  If so, can you get the solution?

<<....they expect to meet Jim Horne, which isn't going to happen.....>>
    Why do you say that?  Were they expecting him to make a  trip to Israel, 
or are they ready to make a trip to Canada?  Why would Jim refuse to meet 
with them?   He's not deceased, is he?

    I looked over the attachment re your new product, but have to say this 
is too far away from my field of operation for me to grasp it.

Best regards.------------------Adrian

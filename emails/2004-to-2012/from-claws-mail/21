Hi Shlomi,

    The first message from you was reaction to my reaction to the movie
"Foutainhead".  Some of my questions were answered by the time I sent you
the second message, but for now I'll respond to what you had to say in your
first message.

<<my blog >>
    I'm sorry, but I haven't looked at that as yet.  You are so prolific in
your thinking that I'd better take one thing at a time, and look at that
later.

<<What's up with you?>>
    Much of the same.  Still take occasional trips, both to pursue my hobby
of railroad history and my semi-business with the software product for
genealogists.  I'm off next week for a week in Austin, Texas then
California.

<<["Fountainhead"] Well, the novel has a relatively good ending. At least
for Howard Roark.>>
    Yes, and as I told you, I later heard much about the story of the movie,
and that Ayn Rand had insisted that the plot must follow the book exactly.
There was one part of the script especially that I thought illustrated the
excesses in Ayn Rand's thinking.  The speech by Roark in the courtroom,
which Rand particularly insisted had to be included verbatim in the movie.
One of the things Roark says is that every great advance, every great
innovation or invention mankind has ever achieved has been rejected by the
public at large at first.  That is certainly a very gross exagerration.  It
might apply to some scientific ideas, for instance Copernicus, but not to
technological inventions.  Were the telephone, the electric light bulb, etc.
rejected?  Hardly.

<<Well, I recall seeing a survey on the Internet that tried to determine
your orientation in the political map. One axis was personal
freedom............>>
    That was an interesting analysis, and I'd largely agree with it.

<<Note that up to a certain point in history, many liberals were in fact
pro-economical freedom.>>
    A digression.  Remember a while back I'd told you I'd bought seven
books, and you expressed surprise?  Well, it's taken me until now, but I'm
now reading the seventh one, entitled "The Anatomy of Facism", and the
author describes quite ably how the meaning of the word "liberalism" has
been transformed, especiallly in the US.  He describes the three great
economic philosophies of the 19th century as conservatism, liberalism and
communism.  But the liberalism of the 19th century bears no relation to what
is now called liberalism in the US.  Back then, it meant essentially free
trade and laissez faire economics.  A theme of the book is how Facism was
strictly a 20th century phenomenon, and I'm finding the book very
interesting in its analysis of how and why it came into being.  BTW, I've
just placed orders now for eight more books.  Might tell you more about one
of them later.

<<I also wrote a parody about it here:
 http://shlomif.il.eu.org/humour/TOWTF/  >>
    That I really wanted to see, and tried to access it, but it didn't want
to be displayed.  Sure everything is spelled right there?

    As to the negative aspect of my reaction to the movie, and your comment
about collectivism, you and I may not be very far apart, but I still feel
Ayn Rand goes much too far in demonizing collectivism.  As I've said, she
caricatures it.

<<P.S: do you have an Instant Messaging account?>>
    I did a spate of it with someone a few years ago, but haven't done much
lately.  Frankly, for our kind of dialogue, I'd prefer to sit back and think
out what I want to say rather than try to carry it out via that medium.
Although if we ever had the chance, I'm sure I'd enjoy sitting down over a
long meal with you.

Best regards, ---------------------------Adrian

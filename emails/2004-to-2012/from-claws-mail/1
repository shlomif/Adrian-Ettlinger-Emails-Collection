Hi Shlomi,

    I know I neglected to respond to a "keep alive" you sent me on July 12, 
and my apologies.  I know I keep saying this, but quite frequently I read 
something or other that reminds me of the dialogue we'd had on political and 
economic philosophy, but never seem to summon up the energy to compose some 
commentary based on it.

    I'm now prompted to write you because of a strange problem which has 
arisen after I got back into trying to resurrect some of the old code 
involved with Freecell solver.  This resulted from hearing from someone who, 
from the evidence, might possibly be the first person who's tried to compile 
the source code which we've made available.  It was three years ago that I 
last worked on this, and one question I'd like to ask you is this:  Where 
was that source code made available on a website?  Is that on your website 
or on one of mine?  One reason for asking is that it is now evident that it 
is incomplete, and whichever of us is now responsible for the content, it 
should be updated.

    Now then, since I wrote that I had a weird problem, I tried it again, 
and now the problem has disappeared.  It disappeared after a fresh start of 
the compiler.  But I'll still ask, just in case you have any ideas.  I was 
getting this persistent error:

fc_pro_iface.obj : error LNK2001: unresolved external symbol _dest_stack_len

    Now then, that symbol "_dest_stack_len" is not one that I find anywhere 
in the code.  Do you have any idea what this means?

Best regards, ---------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    With regard to the copy of the file, re your communications with the 
blog, the way it came through it was very, very difficult to read, because 
all the fomatting was lost, i. e., it was a solid block of text as if all 
the CR/LF characters had been removed.  I did understand that the issue has 
to do with others regarding some of your messages as being harrassing and 
obnoxious.  I guess I wouldn't really be able to make any judgement without 
seeing some examples of what it was the others were objecting to.  I could 
make this general comment, however.  About 5-6 years ago I started 
moderating a blog for a railroad hobby organization.  There's a total 
memberhip of about 600 on the list, and of those, there were two or three 
who stood out as being extremely outspoken and regarded by most of the 
members as totally out of order in how they expressed themselves.  One of 
these people I got to know fairly well, having met him in person a few 
times.  It was very common with these people that they honestly just 
couldn't understand what the others were objecting to.  I had to be very 
patient with this one particular guy, but I finally got him to the point 
where he now behaves in more civilized way.  But through it all, this really 
illustrated to me how it is that some people have a hard time understanding 
why others find the way they talk on Internet to be so objectionable.  Part 
of the problem is that when you say things in print (i. e., in writing on 
Internet) using the same language you might in person, it can come through 
sounding very harsh, where it might not in person because the other person 
can see the expression on your face and react immediately.

    If I had told you about moving to a new residence, then we certainly 
have talked since my 80th birthday, because we were still living at the old 
house when that occurred.  I don't really remember saying I'd felt 
disoriented in the new location, and if I said that it must have been in the 
first few weeks after we'd moved in.  I am by now thoroughly acclimated. 
Our new surroundings are much more rural in nature than where we lived 
before.  Oh, there are houses all around us, but they are much further apart 
than at the old location.  And almost anywhere we drive we past many acres 
of undeveloped land and/or woods.  You mention living near a country club, 
so I gather you are not in a dense urban area yourself.

    From what you've said about yourself, I'm thinking about a book I very 
recently read, and I wonder what you might think of it, or if it might be 
helpful to you.  The author is Thomas Armstrong, and the title is "Seven 
Kinds of Smarts".  It deals with the nature of intelligence and how a person 
can have very highly developed mental ablilities in some areas but be very 
lacking in others, and gives a lot of suggestions as to how one can work on 
himself to create a better balance.  I'm not so sure I fully agree with much 
of what it says, and you might consider it a lot of nonsense, but if you 
haven't heard of it, might be worth your while to take a look.

<< still struggling with "mediocre minds" (to quote Albert Einstein) >>
    Funny you should bring that up, as I just read a biography of Einsten, 
which I found fascinating.  Didn't run across any quotation where he used 
the expression "mediocre minds", although it was obvious he regarded most of 
humanityt that way.  But he was too diplomatic to let his feelings be known 
publicly.  I found him to be a very engaging and congenial personality.  I 
found his philosophy as regards religion is very much identical to mine.  He 
firmly refused tu be classified as an atheist, but his views most 
emphatically were "non-theistic".  Best described as a very generalized form 
of deism.  The basic premise is one that I've long believed, than the human 
mind will never be able to grasp "everything".

    Getting back to that problem you're having with the blog, I wonder if 
you've thought of looking at it analytically, and examined the kind of 
language you had been using, and maybe how your language perhaps differed 
from the language used by others, and just what it was about how you 
expressed yourself that others found so objectionable.

    That's about all for now.  Looking forward to continuing the 
conversation, but you might have to bear with me if I take a few days to 
respond.

Best regards, -----------------Adrian

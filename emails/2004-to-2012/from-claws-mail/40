Hi Shlomi,

    I just heard something on TV which triggered me to write something to
you on this subject.  There's a comedian here by the name of George Carlin,
whose main theme is extreme cynicism.  He's also widely read and
intelligent.  While I consider him totally "off the wall", he came up with
this quotation.  I didn't catch who had originally said it.

"Americans are made to feel free by the exercise of meaningless choices"

    He then went on to say that Americans can buy 450 different kinds of
mustard (as an example), and similar ranges of trivial choices lead
Americans into the delusion that they are free, whereas (in his view), all
the truly significant choices are forced upon them.

    I'm not at all in agreement with such an extreme interpretation, but it
points up the main theme, and the starting point, of what I feel would be a
meaningful discussion of the definition of freedom.  And that is that the
subjective factors are equally if not more important than the objective
factors.  And it's necessary, also, to break down the discussion into
different aspects of freedom.  Political, social, economic.  I'd include
freedom of speech under "social" which also includes freedom of behavior.
Political freedom is more difficult to define.  And in defining it, one must
realize that a maximization of political freedom often leads to a lessening
of social freedom.   In a "pure" democracy", minority rights can easily
become afringed, and a "tyranny of the majority" can evolve.  Economic
freedom is perhaps the most difficult of all.  Here subjective factors are
very important.  Certainly, on an objective basis, we can say there is more
economic freedom in the industrialized western countries than there is in
the third world where many economies verge on the subsistence level.  But
still, no matter how relatively free may be an economy, people will gripe
that they are "working half the time for the government".

    Suppose I just leave it at that for now.  I'll await some comments from
your end.

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

PS.  This is not causing any trouble, but recently your E-mails have been
causing a popup window to appear asking if I want to install a
foreign-language handler.  They are otherwise fully readable, but it leads
me to wonder if you are, deliberately or unintentially, sticking some Hebrew
characters in there somewhere.

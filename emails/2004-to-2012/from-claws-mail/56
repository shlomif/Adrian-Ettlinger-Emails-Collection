Hi Shlomi,

    Thanks very much to the roadmap for Facebook.  I will certainly try that 
routine.

    To bring you up to date with me.  I think it's so long ago that we last 
talked that it was before my wife and I moved to a new house some distance 
from where we were before.  We moved to the area where our daughter has 
lived for quite some time -- in Putnam County, which is the county north of 
Westchester, where we formerly lived toward the south side of that county. 
Even at the distance we are from the city, however, we are close to a 
railroad commuting station from which we can get trains into the city which 
run every hour and take less that 90 minutes.

    The family is doing fine.  In fact, I now have four grandchildren all in 
college.  One grandson is now a Junior in Hofstra U., a well-regarded small 
school on Long Island.  The other grandson is now a sophomore at Rhode 
Island University.  One granddaughter is now a sophomore at New York 
University.  She's the most academically gifted of all, NYU has fairly high 
standards for admission.  The other granddaughter is now a freshman at Rhode 
Island School of Design, considered by many the outstanding art school in 
the country.  She's very talented at art.  So is the other granddaughter, 
but her career interest is more in the direction of the field of medicine --  
she aspires to become a doctor.

    My son is still with a public service organization in Washington. 
Although he doesn't have an economics degree, he is a "Director of Economic 
Policy", and part of his job is to be editor of papers written by PHD 
economists, which he sometimes instructs them to do some rewriting for more 
clarity.  His position is such that he sometimes is invited to appear on TV 
news shows to give his opinion on issues of public policy -- which are 
rather "hot" right now with the presidential campaign.  My daughter has long 
been a public school art teacher, and she recently had a promotion to have 
charge of all art teaching for the school district.

    You asked about cats.  Actually, it's one cat, and he's doing fine. 
He's quite a character.

    As for me, I'm showing the effects of age -- I'm 87 now.  A couple of 
months ago, I had a heart attack.  It was "mild" in the sense that it was 
painless, but it's definitely knocked me down to a still lower lever of 
energy than I was at before, which even then wasn't very high.  I haven't 
been making much progress -- I still seldom leave the house except for 
doctor's visits.  But the cardiologist has told me I should start a rehab 
program of at least some light exercise, which he thinks will help.

    Which reminds me -- my cardiologist obtained his first medical degree in 
Israel -- at the Sachler Medical Faculty of Tel Aviv University.  Are you 
familiar with or acquainted with that school?  I found it interesting that 
it is accredited by New York State, so graduates can be admitted to practice 
in the state with no more formalities than if their degree was from a US 
school.  He told me he really enjoyed his time in Israel -- especially for 
the opportunity to take side trips to places like Egypt.

    So, anyway, I'm waiting to get the update on what has happened in your 
like since we last had contact.  I notice that your Facebook info still 
identifies you with Technion.  I don't suppose that means you are still a 
student, does it?

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

Hi Adrian!

What's new and what have you been up to? How are your cats doing? What about
your children and grandchildren? I hope everything is OK. It's been a long
time.

I can tell you more about my whereabouts after you reply, but regarding
your question about how to remove someone as a Friend on Facebook, then
do this:

1. Go to their facebook page - there is a link to it on every message from
them.

2. You should now see a "V Friends" button where the "V" is a small tick. 
Click
it and hold the mouse button.

3. Choose "Unfriend" at the bottom.

Regards,

Shlomi Fish

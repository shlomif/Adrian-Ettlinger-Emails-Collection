Hi Shlomi,

    OK, that sounds more reasonable.

    In the first review on Amazon, the reviewer seemed to be saying that he
thought Jayne's usage of the word "consciousness" was too broad for his
taste, so he was accepting Jayne only in a narrower context.

    It seems to me the issue here is what was really going on in the minds
of these early humans as they were developing beliefs in Gods.  Thinking
about it, it might not be so far-fetched to call it something akin to
hallucination.  After all, even in the present day, we have people who
sincerely believe they have had visions, or have spoken to God.  As recently
as the 19th Century, the Mormon religion was founded by a man who seems to
have sincerely believed he had visions, atlhough some accuse him of being
nothing more than a charlatan.  Such visions could be called a form of
hallucination.

    But another way to put it is that it was just early humans imaginations
beginning to work.  One question would be whether such imaginings, or
hallucinations, occurred when the individuals were otherwise conscious, or
were they psychic episodes that occurred as dreams when they were asleep?

    Anyway, you've convinced me enough that I'll put the book on my future
reading list.  It comes at a bad time, because I've just bought seven new
books I want to read, and there are already a couple of other books crowding
their way into my reading agenda.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian

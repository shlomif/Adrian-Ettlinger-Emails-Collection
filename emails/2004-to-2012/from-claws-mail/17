Hi Shlomi,

<<<<I have full confidence that you'll pass with flying colors. >>
 Well, you shouldn't................>>
    OK, I get the picture.  My immediate reaction was based on my appraisal
of your mind as being in the "brilliant" category.  But I see you seem to
have an good level of self-understanding of -- what shall I call it? -- some
temperamental problems that handicap you.  I suppose you realize it's all in
the area of getting yourself to apply yourself persistently to your studies.
And that's a problem you can only solve for yourself.

    And those two subjects, thermo and statistics, I'd imagine would be
tough ones for you.  Neither one particularly places a high premium on
imaginative thinking, which is what I'd judge is something at which you
especially excel.  I had a very tough time with thermo myself.  I still wish
I really understood what entropy is.  Anyway, good luck on your grades.
Rereading I see you know you passed thermo, but am still waiting on
Statistics.

    Back to freedom:

    I guess there isn't much area of disagreement.  When you first proposed
a discussion of the meaning of "freedom", I anticipated that the subject
matter would be making judgments as to how to evalute the degree and nature
of the freedom or freedoms as they exist within a given society.  The
broadening of the discussion to include various usages of the word "free",
you apparently understand, tends to dilute the discussion of "freedom" as it
applies a the societal level.

    As you point out (the lottery example), the more money one has, the
greater degree of freedom one feels he has, at least in general terms.
Don't know if you've heard this expression: "Money doesn't buy happiness,
but it sure lets you choose your own form of misery."

<<But what if these doctors were armed.>>
    I'm jumping around in your response to various topics.  I believe I
heard of two such murders, and in both cases they were of the ambush type,
so it wouldn't have done the doctors any good to have been armed.  Of
course, if they'd realized someone was out gunning for them, they might have
protected themselves better.  However, in general, if the principle is
followed that people have to arm themselves to protect rights that society
supposedly guarantees to them, and the society's government does not provide
adequate protection, it is inevitable that violence will result.  One side
or the other will eventually decide to test the other's defenses.

    Thinking back on that expression of Franklin's, I think his tongue was
in his cheek.  Having recently read a biography of Franklin, he actually was
a guy who did a lot of kidding around.  After writing that, I took a look at
the site where you found that.  What's this guy's name?  J. Hubert?  How do
you happen to know of him?  I worked my way back to next higher page on his
site.  For some reason, I couldn't find the link on that page to the
Franklin quotation, and I'd been curious as to just in what context he
pointed to it.  But I found three other quotations which indicate that
Hubert is indeed a libertarian in the Ayn Rand school.  All four of these
quotations, if analyzed with cold logic, can be refuted.  Let's start with
Franklin.  "Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for
lunch."  Technically that might be correct.  "Pure" democracy is absolute
majority rule.  So in theory, the wolves could vote to eat the lamb.  But
this is the classic problem of the "tyranny of the majority".  The design of
democratic government systems requires a system of safeguards of the rights
of minorities.  Such systems never operate to complete perfection, and vary
only to the extent to which they guarantee such rights.  Franklin's next
sentence (if this quotation is authentic -- of which I'm now skeptical) says
that minorities have to arm themselves to protect their rights.  That I'd
call highly disputable.  Minority rights are protected most effectively when
the majority realizes that such rights must be protected, and authorizes its
elected government to use its police powers to enforce such rights.

    Other quotations:
<<M. Friedman
 "There is one and only one social responsibility of business - to use its
resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long
as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open
and free competition, without deception or fraud.">>
    Yeah, that sounds just like Friedman.  He's full of BS, and thinking
very narrowly.  Businesses are given the protection of corporation law by
the state, and can be required to operate in any way the state wishes to
establish.  If the state wants to require other responsibilities of
businesses to which it extends its protection, it is entirlely within its
right and power to do so.  Re "rules of the game" and "without deception or
fraud", that's polyanna thinking.  Business men by their nature use all the
deception and fraud that they think they can get away with.

<<L. von Mises, Human Action, 1949
 "One may try to justify (such a system of social security) by declaring
that the wage earners lack the insight and the moral strength to provide
spontaneously for their own future. But then it is not easy to silence the
voices of those who ask whether it is not paradoxical to entrust the nation’
s welfare to the decisions of voters whom the law itself considers incapable
of managing their own affairs; whether it is not absurd to make those people
supreme in the conduct of government who are manifestly in need of a
guardian to prevent them from spending their own income foolishly. Is it
reasonable to assign to wards the right to elect their guardians."  >>
    And that's vintage von Mises.  The great bulk of the population cannot
possibly rely on its own resources to provide for its own economic welfare
in retirement.  An unregulated investment industry would steal all of their
money.  He refers to a social security system as if it's something imposed
on the population by an authoritarian government.  A more accurate way to
define social security systems in a democracy is that they are in fact
voluntary systems provided by the population as a joint investment program.
They are designed by the elected representatives of the people, and are
supported by the people.

<<Cicero, 106 - 43 BC
The foundation of justice is good faith - in other words, consistency and
truthfulness in regard to promises and compacts.  >>
    That's true enough, but the real question is whether those who gain
financial power will in fact act the way you'd like them to.  I like Lord
Acton's "Power corrupts -- absolute power corrupts absolutely."

<<I got a bit tired of that discussion (Laissez-Faire, etc.). But if you
wish to continue in it, so be it.>>
    I'd agree that the previous thread sort of wore itself out.  But I think
we may be renewing it from a fresh perspective as stimulated by the above
quotations.

Best regards, ---------------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I let our dialogue lapse for a few days.  Due to the sudden change in 
environment, being at the beach with the extended family.  And not getting 
as much computer time as usual because of being surrounded by noisy 
grandkids most of the time.

<< OK. Well, I'm not sure I have enough connections in the industry and 
enough prestige to confidently become a consultant/contractor like that at 
this
point.>>
    Oh, yes, I'm sure that is the case.  You'd have to build it up very 
slowly.  I acquired the connections only after about 22 years in a regular 
job in the industry.  As a matter of fact, there was a time very early in my 
career when I prematurely tried to be a consultant, and after several months 
had to give it up and look for a "day job".  But the world is much different 
today.  I would think with the "Global Village" that is Internet, it would 
be possible for someone to become known at a much faster rate than it was in 
the old days.

<<This is naturally a very simple example, but I hope you get my 
intention.>>
    I got your point.

<<You said that for PBS you did some programming for the Intel 4004.>>
    I did, eh?  At this point in time I wonder if I might have misspoke. 
Right now I only recall working with the 8008.  The more I think about it 
the more I convince myself that 4004 is not correct.  If it isn't too late, 
perhaps the interview should be corrected.  The work I did with the 8008 was 
only to make some minor modifications to code someone else had written in an 
earlier time.

    A digression.  At the moment things are quiet and the only people 
present are my son and the two oldest grandsons, who are wrapped up in a 
sports show on TV.  My son wants to use the computer to send an E-mail and 
asked me what I was doing.  When I told him I was writing to a young friend 
in Israel, and my son said "You should read a book written by a brother of a 
friend of mine, titled "Company C" or "C Company".  The author's name, he 
thinks, is "Watzman" (sp?).  Ever hear of this?  Sounds interesting.  The 
author is a religiously observant Jew who has a fairly progressive attitude 
toward the Palestinians.

    Now, on to Jaynes.

<<<<I wouldn't necessarily agree that there is as sharp a dividing line 
between the "conscious" and the "unconscious" as Jaynes appears to claim.>>
What do you mean? Do you mean that consciousness is integral to the rest of 
the brain's functions, or cannot be separated from it? (I'm waiting for your 
answer so I can better reply).>>
    This is ground we've been over before, and I wish I could recall the 
details.  The outcome was that you corrected my impression of what meaning 
Jaynes is ascribing to the word "consciousness".  The gist of it was that I 
was considering "consciousness" as simply a manifestation of how any animal 
reacts to its sensory perceptions.  And my contention that there is a 
continuous spectrum of degrees of "consciousness" from, at the low end, how 
my cat reacts to seeing a bird to the high end of humans trying to grasp the 
meaning of the universe.  In our past discussion (long past) you gave me the 
more restrictive definition as the word is used by Jaynes.

    Time to shut this off so I can send it.

Best regards, ---------------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    I know I haven't picked up further on our Ayn Rand thread, but I've run
across a passage in a book I'd like to quote to you.  This book is "The
Anatomy of Fascism" by Robert O. Paxton.  I'm almost through it now, and
consider it a brilliant interpretation of a major aspect of the history of
the 20th century.

    The author, toward the end, discusses the possibilities of a revival of
fascism in various environments around the world (including the USA, in an
interesting way).  I should explain that his definition of fascism is that
it can arise only where a people become persuaded to "give up free
institutions" in favor of national unifiicaton.  Hence, by this definition,
fascism cannot arise in any society that does not have free institutions to
start with.  Then, he feels obligated to discuss Israel, because Israel does
have free institutions.  (or purportedly free).  Here's what he says:

    "If religious fascisms are possible, one must address the potential -- 
supreme irony -- for fascism in Israel.  Israeli reactions to the first and
second intifada have been mixed.  Israeli national identity has been
powerfully associated with an affirmation of the human rights that were long
denied to Jews in the Diaspora.  This democratic tradition forms a barrier
against 'giving up free institutions' in the fight against Palestinian
nationalists.  It has been weakened, however, but two trends -- the
inevitable hardening of attitudes in the face of Palestinian intransigence,
and a shift in weight within the Israeli population away from European Jews,
the principal bearers of the democratic tradition, in favor of Jews from
North Africa and elsewhere in the Near East who are indifferent to it.  The
suicide bombers of the second intifada after 2001 radicalized even many
Israeli democrats to the right.  By 2002, it was possible to hear language
within the right wing of the Likud Party and some of the small religious
parties that comes close to a functional equivalent to fasciem.  The chosen
people begins to sound like a Master Race that claims a unique 'mission in
the world,' demands its 'vital space,' demonizes an enemy that obstructs the
realization of the people's destiny, and accepts the necessity of force to
obtain these ends."

    Curious to hear how you might react to that passage.

Best regards, ------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<<But I really would like a steady job with a nice payroll, instead of the 
relatively unpredictable flow of income from articles and gigs.>>
    Very understandable.  That's what I had for the first 25 years of my 
working career, and then I left it for what might have been an uncertain 
situation, relying on a succession of "gigs", but a couple of these gigs 
were fairly long-standing associations, and then I was lucky enough that the 
jobs came along at a good enough pace to keep my continuously occupied.

    But a difference between "then and now" is that I was working in a time 
when software skills were not very widespread, so a couple of my 
associations were  companies too small to have anyone on staff who knew 
anything about software, had no idea what I was doing, and had to rely on me 
to provide the sofware element for a product.  Meaning that my style of 
working could be entirely my own, and consequently, having no formal sofware 
training, I was naturally (for me) very sloppy or negligent when it came to 
documentation, and I could get away with it, although on occassion I 
regretted it when I tried to understand my code a few years after I'd last 
looked at it (like very recently for FcPro).

<<Probably some companies would like people who are independent, think 
outside the box, and are not very small-minded.>>
    Oh, certainly, but they are probably very scarce, so your problem is 
finding where they are "hiding".

<<Are you buying your books from Amazon.com? They have wishlist and other 
mechanisms for that.>>
    Yes, I usually do.  Also, there's an organization here I belong to 
called the "History Book Club", from which I get monthly notices (that I 
have to return to avoid having books sent to me automatically), and they 
provide good bargains.  But you have a point, I should look into what 
features Amazon has to make notes for future purposes.

<<("a company that was briefly very successful built around a product I had 
developed").
Was that related to your Z-80 project? Or was it beforehand, with the Intel 
4004?>>
    Funny how one's memory can draw a blank.  I had to think about it, but 
yes, we did use a Z-80 system for that project.  Lemme see, I don't think 
I'd actually ever used the Intel 4004, but the 8008, and even the 8008 was 
not an original project, but some modification work I did on a 
previously-designed system for a TV broadcast system application.

    Re the origins of religion:  I'm not so sure to what extent I would 
subscribe to the analysis you relate (I'm not sure, either, whether you are 
saying you agree with this or are simply describing Jayne's ideas).  I would 
say there were more than one streams of development which led to the 
patterns of early religion.  I'm not so sure I'd agree that "hearing voices" 
was even a major factor.  I would identify the major impetus as related more 
to the "understanding" or "explanation" of natural phenomenon.  I. e., as 
consciousness developed, people began to "wonder" about "causes" for natural 
phenomenon.  And it was only natural to assume supernatural explanations.  I 
would consider this effect as a precursor to the "hearing of voices".  As 
the forces behind natural phenomenon came to be more and more personalized, 
it became common to imagine that those persons were speaking.   As various 
systems of religion then evolved, it was only to be expected that religion 
would become intertwined with "politics", or patterns of secular personal 
power, with each on occasion trying to make a "tool" of the other.

    The more I think about Jaynes and his division between the "conscious" 
and the "unconscious", I'm thinking that he's designed an analytical tool 
that maybe could contribute to some degree to understanding, but doesn't 
necessarily have much basis in reality.  I. e., I wouldn't necessarily agree 
that there is as sharp a dividing line between the "conscious" and the 
"unconscious" as Jaynes appears to claim.

    With regard to sleeping patterns, when you get to be my age, things 
change quite a bit.  I seem to more and more be getting into a pattern where 
I just have a shorter sleeping cycle.  I. e., my overnight continuous sleep 
will rarely be more than four hours.  Sometimes maybe six or seven hours, 
but broken into two stretches with an hour of reading in between.  But then 
I usually wind up taking a couple of naps during the day of about a 
half-hour each.  Although if I happen to be contnually occupied during the 
day, I don't necessarily miss the naps.

Best regards,--------------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    My wife and I are now at our one-night stopover in Vineland, NJ.  Had 
dinner last night in an excellent restaurant which we discovered here last 
year.  This really is a rather strange city.  It has both upscale and 
downscale aspects.  One way to judge an area in US is by the price of 
gasoline.  Around where I live it's been running typically $2.69/gal.  Here 
it's more like $2.19.  I'm sure that is still cheap compared to Israel, but 
it really seems high to us.

    On the job front, it sounds like things are moving very slow for you. 
I'd say you should still persist in making as many contacts as you can.  My 
hunch is that you would probably fit best into a small company where their 
needs happened to be compatible with what you have to offer, but it might 
take a while to find that company.

<<Other than that, I'm helping in organizing community events. I started 
organizing Israeli Python meetings.....>>
    I'd think that could also be useful in an indirect way for "networking", 
i. e., meeting people from whom you might get leads as to where the jobs 
are.

<<The Ironic thing is that the Gaza strip is not considered part of the 
Israeli Fatherland according to religious Jewish tradition.>>
    That's a new "fact" to me.  Hadn't been aware of that.  Can you tell me 
this:  During the British mandate period, was there much Jewish population 
in Gaza?  Or was it populated almost exclusively by Arabs?

    I suppose I've mentioned to you that I like to read history.  Right now 
I'm in the middle of a book that's taking me to your area.  It's a new 
history of the First Crusade.  At the point where I am now, the crusaders 
are still in northern Syria, and they're trying to get organized to start 
moving south.

Best regards,------------------------------Adrian

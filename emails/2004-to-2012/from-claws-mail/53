Hi Shlomi,

    Thanks for the quick reply.

    I'm astonished at what this tells me.  Here I'd been playing with two 
suits, and this says that 99.41% of games are winnable with four suits.  I 
had played four suits a few times and found that I could win occasionally 
but not very often.  And I'd long considered 2 suits a difficult challenge. 
In fact, I still do and sometimes winning is a struggle.  I guess if it 
starts to be too easy I might shift to playing four suits.

    I might like to contact the author of this to ask him if he's tested it 
with two suits   On a quick look I didn't see an E-mail address for him.  Do 
you have it?

Best regards, ---------------Adrian

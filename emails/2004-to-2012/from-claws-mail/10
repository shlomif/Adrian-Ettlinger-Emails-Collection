Hi Shlomi,

    Thought of a better way to express my skepticism of Jayne.  Maybe it's
just his choice of language.  If he really means literally that early man
spent all his time "unconscious" and "hallucinating", that is utterly
impossible.  All animals must be conscious enough to react to their sensory
perceptions of their environment in order to survive.

    If he's just exagerrating for effect, that's something else.  If what he
really means is that early man, in reacting to the forces of nature (i. e.,
when contending with wind, rain, extreme heat or cold, etc., would have
occasional hallucinatory visions of gods at work, that would be acceptable.
It still sounds to me as if the book could be enlightening, even though
allowances might need to be made for extemities in his vocabulary.

Best regards, -----------------------Adrian

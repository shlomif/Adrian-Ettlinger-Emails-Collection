Hi Shlomi,

    So very sorry I did not reply to your message.  I enjoyed very much
hearing about what you've been up to.  It sounds like you're keeping very
busy.  And you mentioned what sounded like a good prospect for a job with
IBM.

    Thank you for reminding me of Passover.  As I suppose I've told you
before, the extent of my "Jewishness" just does not extend to keeping track
of when the holidays are coming.  But at least I do know that this is Matzoh
time.  Is the dish "Matzoh brie" (sp?) popular in Israel?  Maybe you have
another name for it.  It is essentially broken up matzohs in scrambled eggs,
i.e . a "Matzoh Omelet".  Just by coincidence, my wife made it for us for
dinner a week ago.  First time she thought of doing that in a long, long
time.  It's usually more of a breakfast dish.

    I can't really claim to have been "too busy" to reply to your last
message.  Lately I've become very lazy about keeping up E-mail
correspondence.  There are at least three other people to whom I've owed
messages for several days.

    Just reflecting on this, I find this situation amusing.  That here I am,
the kind of Jew who has to be reminded from Israel when the holidays are
coming.  I suppose the reason is that I just don't have any close friends
who are practicing Jews.

Best regards, ----------------Adrian

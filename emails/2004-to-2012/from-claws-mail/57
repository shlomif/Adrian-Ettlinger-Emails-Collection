Hi Shlomi,

<<Ah. You said something about moving to Carmel or something like that. That
was some time after you turned 80 if I remember correctly.>>
    Oh, didn't realize we last had contact that recently.  That's right, it 
would have been a bit after I turned 80.

<<What does he study?>>
    The one at Hofstra.  I call him, only half jokingly, "The black sheep of 
the family".  He's gravitated toward an interest in finance.  Wants to 
become a millionaire as quickly as possible.  I'm inclined to agree with 
that minority of analysts who say that most of what is done in Wall Street 
is not socially useful.  The trouble is, I think he just might have the 
right mixture of intelligence and social skills to realize his ambitions.

And what does he study?
    The one at U. of Rhode Island.  He's less settled in his ambition. 
Might be leaning toward computer programming.  At one time he aspired to 
film production, as he had developed some skill at amateur film making.  But 
I know from my exposure to Hollywood that that's a very difficult area to 
break into, and generally  requires a long, patience apprenticeship in the 
theater world.  So I'm glad he now is looking away from that.

<<Ah, my older sister (who is still younger than me) has been studying 
Medicine
as well (in the Technion in Haifa) and I think she is now in what we call 
the
"staj" ("stage"?) where you are supposed to get some on-site experience. >>
    That's an interesting coincidence.  My granddaughter has gotten some 
exposure to real medicine.  She did a summer program at our local hospital 
(where we are well-acquainted).  She found it very interesting.  It so 
happens that her boyfriend's mother is head nurse in the cardiac ward at the 
hospital.  That was very useful for me on a couple of occasions when I was a 
short-duration patient there (the first time was for recovery after having a 
pacemaker installed).

    Oh, so you're still working on Freecell-solving.  I always thought that 
was what could become someone's lifetime project.  It certainly appeared to 
me that there exist a small percentage of hands that would be virtually 
"intractable" for just about any solver.  I totally turned my back on that 
game some time ago.  I still have a daily ritual I go through of solving one 
software jigsaw puzzle, playing one game of Hearts, and then solving one 
game of spider solitaire at the two-suit level.  I've come to realize that 
there are only a relatively small finite number of deals one gets with the 
standard Microsoft edition of the game, and all of them are solvable, 
although some require deviating from what would be the most intuitively 
effective moves.

<<Are you still reading a lot of books?>>
    Oh, yes, I continue to read a steady stream of books on various 
subjects.  Right now I don't have any consistent theme.  For some time I got 
interested in the writings of Winston Churchill and read through most of his 
better-known works.  Found him a most congenial and interesting writer.   I 
still mainly concentrate on history.  I read a number of books on German 
history, starting with having an interest in a biography of Bismarck.  My 
son accuses me of always hero-worshipping anyone of whom I read a biography, 
but it was not the case with Bismarck.  In fact, I think the world would 
have been better off if he had never been born.  But this led me to read a 
number of other books about Germany.  One most interesting one was entitled 
"German Genius", a quite objective treatment of how the German mentality led 
to so much accomplishment in science, accompanied of course by the negative 
effects of the German character.  It's interesting that this author reached 
an ultimate conclusion that the Germans have by now finally outgrown their 
negative tendencies and become as a society more like the rest of the world 
with an appreciation for democracy.  I myself have found it interesting that 
the Germans, if you look at the movies they have been making, have finally 
only the past few years become willing to face the worst of what happened in 
WWII, such as to portray with realism what the concentration camps were 
like.

    One thing I wanted to ask you about.  I noticed on Facebook that one of 
your friends seemed be a young Islamic woman who lives in Malaysia.  I 
assume she's Islamic from the head scarf.  How did that come about?  What 
might you be able to tell me about her?

Best regards, -----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

<<So it is possible the messages are sent in UTF-8 (which is an
internationalized encoding) by the mailer by default. (to accomodate for
all possibilities). I have no idea what I can do about it, but maybe you
should just install the foreign-language handler.>>
    That's probably the explanation.  Quite plausible.  It's only a very
minor inconvenience -- just an extra box I have to click on -- and I'd
rather do that than go through an installation.

I said:  "Well, that's a diversion from what I was meaning. I was talking
about different classes of freedom:
And it's necessary, also, to break down the discussion into different
aspects of freedom.  Political, social, economic."

and you said: ""Well, that's a diversion from what I was meaning. I was
talking about different classes of freedom:
1. From opression.
2. From responsibilities.
3. From having to pay money.
4. From work.

    Your list seems strange to me.  But firstly, in my listing of
"Political, social, economic", I'm conforming to a customary division of
spheres of human activity as they are normally divided for scholarly study.
So it seemed to me to be appropriate to consider the concept of freedom as
it applies in each of those spheres.  But let's get back to your list, and
what seems strange.

1. From oppression  --- well, how would one define "oppresion".  Other than
"A restriction in one's freedom".  It implies being coerced by force over
which one has no control.  Or how would you define it?

2:  From responsibilities:  -- I don't know quite what you mean here?  That
the ideal life is one in which one has no responsiblities whatsoever?  I
suppose you'd accept that if one is a member of a family, one should feel
some responsibility toward one's family.  If you don't feel children need
feel any responsibility toward their parents, do parents have some
resposibility toward their children?  Then there's the question of
"responsibility to society".  Whether or not you believe that individuals
have any inherent responsibility to society, there is, I think you'll agree,
at least a minimal responsibility to do no harm to others.  So maybe what
this really means is "freedom to choose one's own responsibilities?

3.  From having to pay money -- surely you don't mean that never having to
pay any money for anything?  Not to be required to pay for goods or services
one wishes to purchase?  Let's face it, isn't what you are referring to is
taxes?  What other kinds of payments should one be free from?

4.  From work -- what does that mean?  No one should ever be required to
work?  Is what you really mean "freedom of choice of work?

<<I don't understand how political freedom can lead to a lessening of social
freedom.>>
    Through a "tyranny of the majority".  An example here in the US, on an
issue that is almost evenly divided, is the freedom of a pregnant woman to
have an abortion.  The so-called "moral majority" here (which IMO is really
a "moral minority") would absolutely prohibit all abortions on the grounds
of an ultraorthodox interpretation of the bible.  There are many other
examples.  I think the dominance of the orthodox in Israel would strike you
as infringing on the freedom of the secular part of the population.

<<Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.
Liberty is a well-armed lamb contesting the vote.>>
    Hadn't heard that one.  You sure Franklin said that (I wouldn't put it
past him :-) ).  However, that metaphor isn't of much help to a woman who
wants an abortion and can't get one from a qualified doctor.

<<does not charge 65% of the wage of working people>>
    Had no idea it was that high.

<<In Israel, the middle class is very poor in comparison to other
Western-world countries. It's an outrage.>>
    Well, if we want to be realistic about it, isn't the primary reason for
that that no one so far has been able to figure out how to get the Arabs to
accept the situation.

    It's probably very difficult for you to look at things from the
perspective of a "normal" society that doesn't have to spend so much of its
wealth simply preserving its existence.

<<If a government charges 10% or 20% in taxes or none at all...>>
    Oh, OK, you'll accept up to 10 or 20%, eh?  I suppose an ideal for a
fully libertarian society would be a government supported entirely by
voluntary contributions.  Wonder if anything like that could ever evolve.
Not for quite some time, I'd guess.

<<where Liberalism is the original term held by Washington, Jefferson, Ben
Franklin, etc.>>
    They had the right idea in the context of their times, but a fully
industrialized economy imposes a range and extent of problems that they
never could have contemplated.

Hi Shlomi,

    Do yoy mean to tell me the last time we talked I hadn't yet reached 80? 
I'm now 83.  Actually, my 80th birthday had a very nice surprise.  My son 
and family came up from the Washington area to surprise me at the birthday 
party at a restaurant.  Then they did the same thing when my wife and I had 
our 50th wedding anniversary.

    I would like to hear about "what's become of you".

    On the family front, my youngest grandson here (around 10) is into the 
sports/exercise routine called Tai Kwan Do, which is Korean in origin.  It 
seems the Korean nation has an annual "festival" for this, and they invite 
people from all over the world.  A large group from my grandson's school are 
going, and my daughter and granddaughter are going too, so they'll be in 
Korea for ten days.

Best regards, -----------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Just ran across a paragraph in a book I'm reading -- the subject of the
book itself is irrelevant -- which strikes me as applicable to our
discussion:

"Although we pride ourselves on American free enterprise and Yankee
ingenuity, the fact is that government frames the way we address almost
every major problem -- social, economic or scientific.  It does this through
law --civil and criminal codes -- but also through administrative
regulations; taxes, taxes, incentives, penalties, and subsidies; and direct
spending for social and technical programs, including research."

    There's an emphasis here on science, because of the subject matter of
the book, but what strikes me most is "...government frames the way we
address almost every major problem...."  I'd say that is an inevitable
consequence of advanced industrial economies.  And I would assert that the
libertrarian impulse is not sufficiently cognizant of this simple fact.  And
that introduction of what libertarianism advocates would bring about sheer
anarchy in the addressing of major problems -- and the problems would no
longer be addressed.

    This book's author, BTW, is essentially apolitical -- his statement
should be viewed as from a scientist concerned entirely with a problem of
science.

Best regards, ---------------------Adrian

Hi Shlomi,

    Sorry for the delay in response.

<<[about 4004 vs. 8008] I'd like to put it put this in a small box saying 
"Note" in the body of the text, after the paragraph where you said that.>>
    That would be fine.

<<Iraq is a seriously messed up country. I didn't trust Saddam Hussein back
at the time. I'm sure he kept a lot of weapons and did not destroy them like
he told, but who knows where they are now. (Syria? Iran?) Obviously,
attacking Iraq had little relevance to the War on Terrorism. Iraq has
supported very little terrorist activity after the first Gulf War, and not
too much beforehand. The Iraqi's regime was not a threat as an advocate of
terrorism, but rather as being a violent, "exceptionally" irrational 
regime.>>
    This is very precisely how I see it, and how many of the most perceptive 
analysts in the US see it.  Personally, I think Bush's war on Iraq is going 
to turn out to be the most colossal foreign policy blunder in the history of 
the US.  The way the Iraqis are writing their constitution, the way it looks 
as of today, they are headed toward splitting the country into three 
separate political entities, with the Shiite area, with most of the oil, 
virtually being handed to Iran.  Of course, around here, as you can imagine, 
it's very difficult for any public figure to say exactly what he thinks 
without being accused of being a "traitor", and not supporting "our heroic 
troops".

<<Now here's some more fuel for future conversation. First of all, my father
recently downloaded some funny and insightful quotes about idea generation 
by
Einstein and other people.>>
    There's a word "serendipity" which applies to this.  I was very struck 
by your bringing up Albert Einstein, because at the time I was reading a 
book that was teaching me much about him that I wasn't aware of before (the 
title of the book is "Einstein's Clocks and Poincare's Maps").   And I was 
much reminded of you.  Einstein was at very young age, about 16 or so, when 
he first started developing an interest in "the nature of the universe". 
And at a very young age, he started becoming skeptical of the then 
prevailing theories.  About the time he had earned his first (undergraduate) 
degree, he started writing letters to the leading physicists of the time. 
There's an existing letter he wrote to his girlfriend telling about one such 
letter in which he describes how he sharply challenges some of the man's 
ideas, and he also says "Of course I told him I didn't have a job."  And, if 
you can take heart from this, Einstein had a very difficult time finding a 
job when he was first out of university.  He wanted to teach, but no 
institution would hire him.  I'm sure you're aware that he went to work for 
the Swiss Patent Office.  Another thing I learned was that that was not as 
"menial" a job as one might imagine (at least in the US these days, the job 
of patent examiner carries virtually no prestige at all). The Swiss Patent 
Office in Einstein's time was a prestigious institution, and the examiners 
generally dealt with inventors very much on their own terms.

    That's about all I have time for right at the moment.

Best regards, ----------------------Adrian

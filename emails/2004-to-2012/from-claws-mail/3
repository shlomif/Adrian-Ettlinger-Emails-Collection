Hi Shlomi,

    We haven't talked directly in quite a while.  I see your messages now 
and then, and glad to see you're still working on the FC solver.

    Here's a question.  I may have mentioned quite a while to you that my 
solitaire playing had moved to Spider.  That is the ten-column spider 
supplied with Windows.  I've been playing it with two colors.  Over a few 
years of playing, I had developed an opinion that only maybe 50-75% of games 
were winnable.  But gradually over that past several weeks, I've become more 
and more persistent at tackling games that seemed on first or second try to 
be unwinnable, and now it's beginning to look to me like virtually all 
two-color games are winnable.  At least, I would say that I've been able to 
win the past thirty or forty deals that I've played.  Some have been 
difficult, taking several starts, but haven't found one that stumped me over 
that span.

    My question is: Do you know of any solver that's been written for this 
game?  If I find a deal that I cannot solve, I'd like to have a way to test 
it.

    And I see it's about time for me to wish you a Happy Chanukah.  This 
year for the first time in quite a while, I think I'll burn candles.

Best regards, ------------------Adrian
